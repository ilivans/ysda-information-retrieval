Abstract
Partial monitoring is a general model for sequential learning with limited feedback formalized as a game between two players. In this game, the learner chooses an action and at the same time the opponent chooses an outcome, then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal. The goal of the learner is to minimize the total loss. In this paper, we study partial monitoring with finite actions and stochastic outcomes. We derive a logarithmic distribution-dependent regret lower bound that defines the hardness of the problem. Inspired by the DMED algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010) for the multi-armed bandit problem, we propose PM-DMED, an algorithm that minimizes the distribution-dependent regret. PM-DMED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in numerical experiments. To show the optimality of PM-DMED with respect to the regret bound, we slightly modify the algorithm by introducing a hinge function (PMDMED-Hinge). Then, we derive an asymptotically optimal regret upper bound of PM-DMED-Hinge that matches the lower bound.
1 Introduction
Partial monitoring is a general framework for sequential decision making problems with imperfect feedback. Many classes of problems, including prediction with expert advice [1], the multi-armed bandit problem [2], dynamic pricing [3], the dark pool problem [4], label efficient prediction [5], and linear and convex optimization with full or bandit feedback [6, 7] can be modeled as an instance of partial monitoring.
Partial monitoring is formalized as a repeated game played by two players called a learner and an opponent. At each round, the learner chooses an action, and at the same time the opponent chooses an outcome. Then, the learner observes a feedback signal from a given set of symbols and suffers some loss, both of which are deterministic functions of the selected action and outcome.
The goal of the learner is to find the optimal action that minimizes his/her cumulative loss. Alternatively, we can define the regret as the difference between the cumulative losses of the learner and the single optimal action, and minimization of the loss is equivalent to minimization of the regret. A learner with a small regret balances exploration (acquisition of information about the strategy of the opponent) and exploitation (utilization of information). The rate of regret indicates how fast the learner adapts to the problem: a linear regret indicates the inability of the learner to find the optimal action, whereas a sublinear regret indicates that the learner can approach the optimal action given sufficiently large time steps.

The study of partial monitoring is classified into two settings with respect to the assumption on the outcomes. On one hand, in the stochastic setting, the opponent chooses an outcome distribution before the game starts, and an outcome at each round is an i.i.d. sample from the distribution. On the other hand, in the adversarial setting, the opponent chooses the outcomes to maximize the regret of the learner. In this paper, we study the former setting.

1.1 Related work

The paper by Piccolboni and Schindelhauer [8] is one of the first to study the regret of the finite par-

tial monitoring problem. They proposed the FeedExp3 algorithm, which attains O(T 3/4) minimax

regret on some problems. This bound was later improved by Cesa-Bianchi et al. [9] to O(T 2/3),

who also showed an instance in which the bound is optimal. Since then, most literature on partial

monitoring has dealt with the minimax regret, which is the worst-case regret over all possible op-

ponent's in terms

strategies. Bartok et al. of the minimax regret:

monitoring problems is not limited to the bandit sort but also such as dynamic pricing. Since then, several algorithms with a

regret bound for easy problems have been proposed [11, 12, 13]. Among them, the Bayes-update

Partial Monitoring (BPM) algorithm [13] is state-of-the-art in the sense of empirical performance.

Distribution-dependent and minimax regret: we focus on the distribution-dependent regret that depends on the strategy of the opponent. While the minimax regret in partial monitoring has been extensively studied, little has been known on distribution-dependent regret in partial monitoring. To the authors' knowledge, the only paper focusing on the distribution-dependent regret in finite discrete partial monitoring is the one by Bartok et al. [11], which derived O(log T ) distribution-dependent regret for easy problems. In contrast to this situation, much more interest in the distribution-dependent regret has been shown in the field of multi-armed bandit problems. Upper confidence bound (UCB), the most well-known algorithm for the multi-armed bandits, has a distribution-dependent regret bound [2, 14], and algorithms that minimize the distribution-dependent regret (e.g., KL-UCB) has been shown to perform better than ones that minimize the minimax regret (e.g., MOSS), even in instances in which the distributions are hard to distinguish (e.g., Scenario 2 in Garivier et al. [15]). Therefore, in the field of partial monitoring, we can expect that an algorithm that minimizes the distribution-dependent regret would perform better than the existing ones.

Contribution: the contributions of this paper lie in the following three aspects. First, we derive the regret lower bound: in some special classes of partial monitoring (e.g., multi-armed bandits), an O(log T ) regret lower bound is known to be achievable. In this paper, we further extend this lower bound to obtain a regret lower bound for general partial monitoring problems. Second, we propose an algorithm called Partial Monitoring DMED (PM-DMED). We also introduce a slightly modified version of this algorithm (PM-DMED-Hinge) and derive its regret bound. PM-DMED-Hinge is the first algorithm with a logarithmic regret bound for hard problems. Moreover, for both easy and hard problems, it is the first algorithm with the optimal constant factor on the leading logarithmic term. Third, performances of PM-DMED and existing algorithms are compared in numerical experiments. Here, the partial monitoring problems consisted of three specific instances of varying difficulty. In all instances, PM-DMED significantly outperformed the existing methods when a number of rounds is large. The regret of PM-DMED on these problems quickly approached the theoretical lower bound.

2 Problem Setup
This paper studies the finite stochastic partial monitoring problem with N actions, M outcomes, and A symbols. An instance of the partial monitoring game is defined by a loss matrix L = (li,j)  RNxM and a feedback matrix H = (hi,j)  [A]NxM , where [A] = {1, 2, . . . , A}. At the beginning, the learner is informed of L and H. At each round t = 1, 2, . . . , T , a learner selects an action i(t)  [N ], and at the same time an opponent selects an outcome j(t)  [M ]. The learner

suffers loss li(t),j(t), which he/she cannot observe: the only information the learner receives is the signal hi(t),j(t)  [A]. We consider a stochastic opponent whose strategy for selecting outcomes is governed by the opponent's strategy p  PM , where PM is a set of probability distributions over an M -ary outcome. The outcome j(t) of each round is an i.i.d. sample from p.

The goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative loss over T

rounds. Let the optimal action be the one that minimizes the loss in expectation, that is, i = arg mini[N] Li p, where Li is the i-th row of L. Assume that i is unique. Without loss of generality, we can assume that i = 1. Let i = (Li - L1)p  [0, ) and Ni(t) be the number of rounds before the t-th in which action i is selected. The performance of the algorithm is measured by the (pseudo) regret,

alent to minimizing the regret. The expectation of the regret measures the performance of an algo-

rithm that the learner uses.

For each action i  [N ], let Ci be the set of opponent strategies for which action i is optimal:
Ci = {q  PM : j=i(Li - Lj )q  0}.
We call Ci the optimality cell of action i. Each optimality cell is a convex closed polytope. Furthermore, we call the set of optimality cells {C1, . . . , CN } the cell decomposition as shown in Figure 1. Let Cic = PM \ Ci be the set of strategies with which action i is not optimal.
The signal matrix Si  {0, 1}AxM of action i is defined as (Si)k,j = 11[hi,j = k], where 11[X] = 1 if X is true and 0 otherwise. The signal matrix defined here is slightly different from the one in the previous papers (e.g., Bartok et al. [10]) in which the number of rows of Si is the number of the different symbols in the i-th row of H. The advantage in using the definition here is that, Sip  RA is a probability distribution over symbols that the algorithm observes when it selects an action i. Examples of signal matrices are shown in Section 5. An instance of partial monitoring is globally observable if for all pairs i, j of actions, Li - Lj  k[N]ImSk. In this paper, we exclusively deal with globally observable instances: in view of the minimax regret, this includes trivial, easy, and hard problems.

3 Regret Lower Bound

A good algorithm should work well against any opponent's strategy. We extend this idea by intro-
ducing the notion of strong consistency: a partial monitoring algorithm is strongly consistent if it satisfies E[Regret(T )] = o(T a) for any a > 0 and p  PM given L and H.

In the context of the multi-armed bandit problem, Lai and Robbins [2] derived the regret lower bound of a strongly consistent algorithm: an algorithm must select each arm i until its number of draws Ni(t) satisfies log t  Ni(t)d(i1), where d(i1) is the KL divergence between the two one-parameter distributions from which the rewards of action i and the optimal action are generated.
Analogously, in the partial monitoring problem, we can define the minimum number of observations.

Lemma 1. For sufficiently large T , a strongly consistent algorithm satisfies:

distributions, in which we define 0 log 0/0 = 0.

Lemma 1 can be interpreted as follows: for each round t, consistency requires the algorithm to make sure that the possible risk that action i = 1 is optimal is smaller than 1/t. Large deviation principle [16] states that, the probability that an opponent with strategy q behaves like p is

actions 1/t.

The proof of Lemma 1 is in Appendix B in the supplementary material. Based on the technique used in Lai and Robbins [2], the proof considers a modified game in which another action i = 1 is optimal. The difficulty in proving the lower bound in partial monitoring lies in that, the feedback structure can be quite complex: for example, to confirm the superiority of action 1 over 2, one might need to use the feedback from action 3 / {1, 2}. Still, we can derive the lower bound by utilizing the consistency of the algorithm in the original and modified games.

4 PM-DMED Algorithm

In this section, we describe the partial monitoring deterministic minimum empirical divergence (PM-

DMED) algorithm, which is inspired by DMED [17] for solving the multi-armed bandit problem.

Let pi(t)  Namely, the

[0, 1]A be the k-th element of

sometimes omit t from pi when it is clear from the context. Let the empirical divergence of q  PM

be i[N] Ni(t)D(pi(t)Siq), the exponential of which can be considered as a likelihood that q is

the opponent's strategy.

The main routine of PM-DMED is in Algorithm 1. At each loop, the actions in the current list ZC are selected once. The list for the actions in the next loop ZN is determined by the subroutine in Algorithm 2. The subroutine checks whether the empirical divergence of each point q  C1c is larger than log t or not (Eq. (3)). If it is large enough, it exploits the current information by selecting i(t), the optimal action based on the estimation p(t) that minimizes the empirical divergence. Otherwise, it selects the actions with the number of observations below the minimum requirement for making the empirical divergence of each suboptimal point q  C1c larger than log t.
Unlike the N -armed bandit problem in which a reward is associated with an action, in the partial monitoring problem, actions, outcomes, and feedback signals can be intricately related. Therefore, we need to solve a non-trivial optimization to run PM-DMED. Later in Section 5, we discuss a practical implementation of the optimization.

and put all actions i such that i / ZR and ri > Ni(t)/ log t into ZN .

 Necessity of log T exploration: PM-DMED tries to observe each action to some extent (Eq. (2)),

which is necessary for the following reason: consider a four-state game characterized by

The optimal action here is action 1, which does not yield any useful information. By using action 2, one receives three kinds of symbols from which one can estimate (p)1, (p)2 + (p)3, and (p)4, where (p)j is the j-th component of p. From this, an algorithm can find that (p)1 is not very small and thus the expected loss of actions 2 and 3 is larger than that of action 1. Since the feedback
of actions 2 and 3 are the same, one may also use action 3 in the same manner. However, the loss per
observation is 1.2 and 1.3 for actions 2 and 3, respectively, and thus it is better to use action 2. This difference comes from the fact that (p)2 = 0.2 < 0.3 = (p)3. Since an algorithm does not know p beforehand, it needs to observe action 4, the only source for distinguishing (p)2 from (p)3. Yet, an optimal algorithm cannot select it more than (log T ) times because it affects the O(log T ) factor in the regret. In fact, O((log T )a) observations of action 4 with some a > 0 are sufficient to be convinced that (p)2 < (p)3 with probability 1 - o(1/T poly(a)). For this reason, PM-DMED selects each action log t times.

5 Experiment

Following Bartok et al. [11], we compared the performances of algorithms in three different games: the four-state game (Section 4), a three-state game and dynamic pricing. Experiments on the N armed bandit game was also done, and the result is shown in Appendix C.1 .

The three-state game, which is classified as easy in terms of the minimax regret, is characterized by:

Dynamic pricing, which is classified as hard in terms of the minimax regret, is a game that models

a repeated auction between a seller (learner) and a buyer (opponent). At each round, the seller sets

a price for a product, and at the same time, the buyer secretly sets a maximum price he is willing to

pay. The signal is "buy" or "no-buy", and the seller's loss is either a given constant (no-buy) or the

difference between the buyer's and the seller's prices (buy). The loss and feedback matrices are:

Following Bartok et al. [11], we set N = 5, M = 5, and c = 2.

In our experiments with the three-state game and dynamic pricing, we tested three settings regarding
the harshness of the opponent: at the beginning of a simulation, we sampled 1,000 points uniformly at random from PM , then sorted them by C1(p, {pi }). We chose the top 10%, 50%, and 90% harshest ones as the opponent's strategy in the harsh, intermediate, and benign settings, respectively.

We compared Random, FeedExp3 [8], CBP [11] with  = 1.01, BPM-LEAST, BPM-TS [13], and

PM-DMED with c = 1. Random is a naive algorithm that selects an action uniformly random. FeedExp3 requires a matrix G such that HG = L, and thus one cannot apply it to the four-state

game. CBP is an algorithm of logarithmic regret for easy games. The parameters  and f (t) of

then put the actions not in ZR into ZN .

(7) (8) (9) (10)

and put all actions such that i / ZR and ri > Ni(t)/ log t into ZN . If such ri is infeasible then put all action i / ZR into ZN .

The computation of p(t) in (1) and the evaluation of the condition in (3) involve convex optimizations, which were done with Ipopt [18]. Moreover, obtaining {ri} in (4) is classified as a linear semi-infinite programming (LSIP) problem, a linear programming (LP) with finitely many variables and infinitely many constraints. Following the optimization of BPM-LEAST [13], we resorted to a finite sample approximation and used the Gurobi LP solver [19] in computing {ri}: at each round, we sampled 1,000 points from PM , and relaxed the constraints on the samples. To speed up the computation, we skipped these optimizations in most rounds with large t and used the result of the last computation. The computation of the coefficient C1(p, {pi }) of the regret lower bound (Theorem 2) is also an LSIP, which was approximated by 100,000 sample points from C1c.
The experimental results are shown in Figure 2. In the four-state game and the other two games with an easy or intermediate opponent, PM-DMED outperforms the other algorithms when the number of rounds is large. In particular, in the dynamic pricing game with an intermediate opponent, the regret of PM-DMED at T = 106 is ten times smaller than those of the other algorithms. Even in the harsh setting in which the minimax regret matters, PM-DMED has some advantage over all algorithms except for BPM-TS. With sufficiently large T , the slope of an optimal algorithm should converge to LB. In all games and settings, the slope of PM-DMED converges to LB, which is empirical evidence of the optimality of PM-DMED.

6 Theoretical Analysis

Section 5 shows that the empirical performance of PM-DMED is very close to the regret lower

bound in Theorem 2. Although the authors conjecture that PM-DMED is optimal, it is hard to

analyze PM-DMED. The technically hardest part arises from the case in which the divergence of

each action is small but not yet fully converged. To circumvent this difficulty, we can introduce a

discount factor. Let

where (X)+ = max(X, 0). Note that Rj({pi, i}) in (11) is a natural generalization of Rj({pi})
in Section 4 in the sense that Rj({pi, 0}) = Rj({pi}). Event {Ni(t)/ log t}i=1  R1({pi(t), i}) means that the number of observations {Ni(t)} is enough to ensure that the "{i}-discounted" empirical divergence of each q  C1c is larger than log t. Analogous to Rj({pi, i}), we define

We also define Ci, = {p  PM : Li p +   minj=i Lj p}, the optimal region of action i with margin. PM-DMED-Hinge shares the main routine of Algorithm 1 with PM-DMED and lists
the next actions by Algorithm 3. Unlike PM-DMED, it (i) discounts f (Ni(t)) from the empirical divergence D(pi(t)Siq). Moreover, (ii) when p(t) is close to the cell boundary, it encourages more exploration to identify the cell it belongs to by Eq. (6).
Theorem 3. Assume that the following regularity conditions hold for p. (1) R1(p, {pi, i}) is unique at p = p, pi = Sip, i = 0. Moreover, (2) for S = {q : D(p1S1q)  }, it holds that cl(int(C1c)  S) = cl(cl(C1c)  S) for all   0 in some neighborhood of  = 0, where cl(*) and int(*) denote the closure and the interior, respectively. Then,

E[Regret(T )]  C1(p, {pi }) log T + o(log T ) .

We prove this theorem in Appendix D . Recall that R1(p, {pi(t), i}) is the set of optimal solutions of an LSIP. In this problem, KKT conditions and the duality theorem apply as in the case of finite constraints; thus, we can check whether Condition 1 holds or not for each p (see, e.g., Ito et al. [20]
and references therein). Condition 2 holds in most cases, and an example of an exceptional case is
shown in Appendix A.

Theorem 3 states that PM-DMED-Hinge has a regret upper bound that matches the lower bound of Theorem 2.

Corollary 4. (Optimality in the N -armed bandit problem) In the N -armed Bernoulli bandit prob-

lem, the regularity conditions in Theorem 3 always hold. Moreover, the coefficient of the lead-

ing logarithmic term in the regret bound of the given in Lai and Robbins [2]. Namely, C1(p,

partial {pi })

=monitNio=r1in(g ip/rdo(bleimi1s))e,qwuahlertoe

the bound d(pq) =

p log (p/q) + (1 - p) log ((1 - p)/(1 - q)) is the KL-divergence between Bernoulli distributions.

Corollary 4, which is proven in Appendix C, states that PM-DMED-Hinge attains the optimal regret of the N -armed bandit if we run it on an N -armed bandit game represented as partial monitoring.

Asymptotic analysis: it is Theorem 6 where we lose the finite-time property. This theorem shows the continuity of the optimal solution set R1(p, {pi, i}) of Cj(p, {pj}), which does not mention how close R1(p, {pi, i}) is to R1(p, {pi , 0}) if max{p-pM , maxi pi -pi M , maxi i}   for given . To obtain an explicit bound, we need sensitivity analysis, the theory of the robustness
of the optimal value and the solution for small deviations of its parameters (see e.g., Fiacco [21]).
In particular, the optimal solution of partial monitoring involves an infinite number of constraints,
which makes the analysis quite hard. For this reason, we will not perform a finite-time analysis. Note that, the N -armed bandit problem is a special instance in which we can avoid solving the
above optimization and a finite-time optimal bound is known.

Necessity of the discount factor: we are not sure whether discount factor f (n) in PM-DMEDHinge is necessary or not. We also empirically tested PM-DMED-Hinge: although it is better than the other algorithms in many settings, such as dynamic pricing with an intermediate opponent, it is far worse than PM-DMED. We found that our implementation, which uses the Ipopt nonlinear optimization solver, was sometimes inaccurate at optimizing (5): there were some cases in which the true p satisfies i[N]D(pi(t)Sip) - f (Ni(t)) = 0, while the solution p(t) we obtained had non-zero hinge values. In this case, the algorithm lists all actions from (7), which degrades performance. Determining whether the discount factor is essential or not is our future work.

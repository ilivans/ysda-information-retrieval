Abstract

We develop a new bidirectional algorithm for estimating Markov chain multi-step

transition probabilities: given a Markov chain, we want to estimate the proba-

bility of hitting a given target state in steps after starting from a given source

distribution. Given the target state t, we use a (reverse) local power iteration to

construct an `expanded target distribution', which has the same mean as the quan-

tity we want to estimate, but a smaller variance - this can then be sampled effi-

ciently by a Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method extends to any Markov chain on

a discrete (finite or countable) state-space, and can be extended to compute func-

tions of multi-step transition probabilities such as PageRank, graph diffusions, hit-

ting/return times, etc. Our main result is that in `sparse' Markov Chains - wherein

the number of transitions between states is comparable to the number of states -

the running time of our algorithm for a uniform-random target node is order-wise

smaller method

1 Introduction

Markov chains are one of the workhorses of stochastic modeling, finding use across a variety of applications - MCMC algorithms for simulation and statistical inference; to compute network centrality metrics for data mining applications; statistical physics; operations management models for reliability, inventory and supply chains, etc. In this paper, we consider a fundamental problem associated with Markov chains, which we refer to as the multi-step transition probability estimation (or MSTP-estimation) problem: given a Markov Chain on state space S with transition matrix P , an initial source distribution  over S, a target state t  S and a fixed length , we are interested in computing the -step transition probability from  to t. Formally, we want to estimate:

p[t] := P , et = P eTt ,

(1)

where et is the indicator vector of state t. A natural parametrization for the complexity of MSTPestimation is in terms of the minimum transition probabilities we want to detect: given a desired
minimum detection threshold , we want algorithms that give estimates which guarantee small rela-
tive error for any (, t, ) such that p[t] > .

Parametrizing in terms of the minimum detection threshold  can be thought of as benchmarking against a standard Monte Carlo algorithm, which estimates p[t] by sampling independent -step paths starting from states sampled from . An alternate technique for MSTP-estimation is based on linear algebraic iterations, in particular, the (local) power iteration. We discuss these in more detail in Section 1.2. Crucially, however, both these techniques have a running time of (1/) for testing if p[t] >  (cf. Section 1.2).

1.1 Our Results
To the best of our knowledge, our work gives the first bidirectional algorithm for MSTP-estimation which works for general discrete state-space Markov chains1. The algorithm we develop is very simple, both in terms of implementation and analysis. Moreover, we prove that in many settings, it is order-wise faster than existing techniques.
Our algorithm consists of two distinct forward and reverse components, which are executed sequentially. In brief, the two components proceed as follows:
* Reverse-work: Starting from the target node t, we perform a sequence of reverse local power iterations - in particular, we use the REVERSE-PUSH operation defined in Algorithm 1.
* Forward-work: We next sample a number of random walks of length , starting from  and transitioning according to P , and return the sum of residues on the walk as an estimate of p[t].
This full algorithm, which we refer to as the Bidirectional-MSTP estimator, is formalized in Algorithm 2. It works for all countable-state Markov chains, giving the following accuracy result:
Theorem 1 (For details, refer Section 2.3). Given any Markov chain P , source distribution , terminal state t, length , threshold  and relative error , Bidirectional-MSTP (Algorithm 2) returns an unbiased estimate p[t] for p[t], which, with high probability, satisfies:
p[t] - p[t] < max p[t],  .
Since we dynamically adjust the number of REVERSE-PUSH operations to ensure that all residues are small, the proof of the above theorem follows from straightforward concentration bounds.
Since Bidirectional-MSTP combines local power iteration and Monte Carlo techniques, a natural question is when the algorithm is faster than both. It is easy to to construct scenarios where the runtime of Bidirectional-MSTP is comparable to its two constituent algorithms - for example, if t has more than 1/ in-neighbors. Surprisingly, however, we show that in sparse Markov chains and for typical target states, Bidirectional-MSTP is order-wise faster:
Theorem 2 (For details, refer Section 2.3). Given any Markov chain P , source distribution , length , threshold  and desired accuracy ; then for a uniform random choice of t  S, the
Bidirectional-MSTP algorithm has a running time of O( 3/2 d/), where d is the average number of neighbors of nodes in S.
 Thus, for typical targets, we can estimate transition probabilities of order  in time only O(1/ ). Note that we do not need for every state that the number of neighboring states is small, but rather, that they are small on average - for example, this is true in `power-law' networks, where some nodes have very high degree, but the average degree is small. The proof of this result is based on a modification of an argument in [2] - refer Section 2.3 for details.
Estimating transition probabilities to a target state is one of the fundamental primitives in Markov chain models - hence, we believe that our algorithm can prove useful in a variety of application domains. In Section 3, we briefly describe how to adapt our method for some of these applications - estimating hitting/return times and stationary probabilities, extensions to non-homogenous Markov chains (in particular, for estimating graph diffusions and heat kernels), connections to local algorithms and expansion testing. In addition, our MSTP-estimator could be useful in several other applications - estimating ruin probabilities in reliability models, buffer overflows in queueing systems, in statistical physics simulations, etc.
1.2 Existing Approaches for MSTP-Estimation
There are two main techniques used for MSTP-estimation. The first is a natural Monte Carlo algorithm: we estimate p[t] by sampling independent -step paths, each starting from a random state sampled from . A simple concentration argument shows that for a given value of , we need (1/) samples to get an accurate estimate of p[t], irrespective of the choice of t, and the structure
1Bidirectional estimators have been developed before for reversible Markov chains [1]; our method however is not only more general, but conceptually and operationally simpler than these techniques (cf. Section 1.2).

of P . Note that this algorithm is agnostic of the terminal state t; it gives an accurate estimate for any t such that p[t] > .
On the other hand, the problem also admits a natural linear algebraic solution, using the standard power iteration starting with , or the reverse power iteration starting with et (which is obtained by re-writing Equation (1) as p[t] := (et(P T ) )T ). When the state space is large, performing a direct power iteration is infeasible - however, there are localized versions of the power iteration that are still efficient. Such algorithms have been developed, among other applications, for PageRank estimation [3, 4] and for heat kernel estimation [5]. Although slow in the worst case 2, such local update algorithms are often fast in practice, as unlike Monte Carlo methods they exploit the local structure of the chain. However even in sparse Markov chains and for a large fraction of target states, their running time can be (1/). For example, consider a random walk on a random dregular graph and let  = o(1/n) - then for  logd(1/), verifying pes [t] >  is equivalent to uncovering the entire logd(1/) neighborhood of s. Since a large random d-regular graph is (whp) an expander, this neighborhood has (1/) distinct nodes. Finally, note that as with Monte Carlo, power iterations can be adapted to either the source or terminal state, but not both.
For reversible Markov chains, one can get a bidirectional algorithms for estimating pes [t] based on colliding random walks. For example, consider the problem of estimating length-2 random walk transition probabilities in a regular undirected graph G(V, E) on n vertices [1, 6]. The main idea is that to test if a random walk goes from s to t in 2 steps with probability  , we can generate two independent random walks of length , starting from s and t respectively, and detect if they terminate at the same intermediate node. Suppose pw, qw are the probabilities that a length- walk from s and t respectively terminate at node w - then from the reversibility of the chain, we have that p2 [t] = wV pwqw; this is also the collision probability. The critical observation is that if we
generate 1/ walks from s and t, then we get 1/ potential collisions, which is sufficient to detect if p2 [t] > . This argument forms the basis of the birthday-paradox, and similar techniques used in a variety of estimation problems (eg., see [7]). Showing concentration for this estimator is tricky as the samples are not independent; moreover, to control the variance of the samples, the algorithms often need to separately deal with `heavy' intermediate nodes, where pw or qw are much larger than O(1/n). Our proposed approach is much simpler both in terms of algorithm and analysis, and more significantly, it extends beyond reversible chains to any general discrete state-space Markov chain.
The most similar approach to ours is the recent FAST-PPR algorithm of Lofgren et al. [2] for PageRank estimation; our algorithm borrows several ideas and techniques from that work. However, the FAST-PPR algorithm relies heavily on the structure of PageRank - in particular, the fact that the PageRank walk has Geometric() length (and hence can be stopped and restarted due to the memoryless property). Our work provides an elegant and powerful generalization of the FAST-PPR algorithm, extending the approach to general Markov chains.

2 The Bidirectional MSTP-estimation Algorithm

2.1 Algorithm
As described in Section 1.1, given a target state t, our bidirectional MSTP algorithm keeps track of a pair of vectors - the estimate vector qkt  Rn and the residual vector rkt  Rn - for each length k  {0, 1, 2, . . . , }. The vectors are initially all set to 0 (i.e., the all-0 vector), except rt0 which is initialized as et. Moreover, they are updated using a reverse push operation defined as:

Algorithm 1 REVERSE-PUSH(v, i)

Inputs: Transition matrix P , estimate vector qit, residual vectors rit, rit+1 1: return New estimate vectors {qit} and residual-vectors {rit} computed as:

qit  qit + rit, ev ev;

rit  rit - rit, ev ev;

rit+1  rit+1 + rit, ev

evP T

2In particular, local power iterations are slow if a state has a very large out-neighborhood (for the forward iteration) or in-neighborhood (for the reverse update).
3

The main observation behind our algorithm is that we can re-write p[t] in terms of {qkt , rkt } as an expectation over random sample-paths of the Markov chain as follows (cf. Equation (3)):

p[t] = , qt + EVkP k rt-k(Vk)
k=0

(2)

In other words, given vectors {qkt , rkt }, we can get an unbiased estimator for p[t] by sampling a length- random trajectory {V0, V1, . . . , V } of the Markov chain P starting at a random state V0 sampled from the source distribution , and then adding the residuals along the trajectory as in
Equation (2). We formalize this bidirectional MSTP algorithm in Algorithm 2.

2.2 Some Intuition Behind our Approach
Before formally analyzing the performance of our MSTP-estimation algorithm, we first build some intuition as to why it works. In particular, it is useful to interpret the estimates and residues in probabilistic/combinatorial terms. In Figure 1, we have considered a simple Markov chain on three states - Solid, Hollow and Checkered (henceforth (S, H, C)). On the right side, we have illustrated an intermediate stage of reverse work using S as the target, after performing the REVERSE-PUSH operations (S, 0), (H, 1), (C, 1) and (S, 2) in that order. Each push at level i uncovers a collection

of length-(i + 1) paths terminating at S - for example, in the figure, we have uncovered all length 2 and 3 paths, and several length 4 paths. The crucial observation is that each uncovered path of length i starting from a node v is accounted for in either qiv or riv. In particular, in Figure 1, all paths starting at solid nodes are stored in the estimates of the corresponding states, while those starting at blurred nodes are stored in the residue. Now we can use this set of pre-discovered paths to boost the estimate returned by Monte Carlo trajectories generated starting from the source distribution. The dotted line in the figure represents the current reverse-work frontier - it separates the fully uncovered neighborhood of (S, 0) from the remaining states (v, i).
In a sense, what the REVERSE-PUSH operation does is construct a sequence of importancesampling weights, which can then be used for Monte Carlo. An important novelty here is that the importance-sampling weights are: (i) adapted to the target state, and (ii) dynamically adjusted to ensure the Monte Carlo estimates have low variance. Viewed in this light, it is easy to see how the algorithm can be modified to applications beyond basic MSTP-estimation: for example, to nonhomogenous Markov chains, or for estimating the probability of hitting a target state t for the first time in steps (cf. Section 3). Essentially, we only need an appropriate reverse-push/dynamic programming update for the quantity of interest (with associated invariant, as in Equation (2)).

2.3 Performance Analysis

We first formalize the critical invariant introduced in Equation (2):
Lemma 1. Given a terminal state t, suppose we initialize q0t = 0, r0t = et and qkt , rkt = 0  k  0. Then for any source distribution  and length , after any arbitrary sequence of REVERSEPUSH(v, k) operations, the vectors {qkt , rkt } satisfy the invariant:

p[t] = , qt + P k, rt-k
k=0

(3)

The proof follows the outline of a similar result in Andersen et al. [4] for PageRank estimation; due to lack of space, we defer it to our full version [8]. Using this result, we can now characterize the accuracy of the Bidirectional-MSTP algorithm:
Theorem 1. We are given any Markov chain P , source distribution , terminal state t, maximum length max and also parameters , pf and (i.e., the desired threshold, failure probability and relative error). Suppose we choose any reverse threshold r > , and set the number of samplepaths nf = cr/, where c = max 6e/ 2, 1/ ln 2 ln (2 max/pf ). Then for any length  max with probability at least 1 - pf , the estimate returned by Bidirectional-MSTP satisfies:
p[t] - p[t] < max p[t],  .

Proof. Given any Markov chain P and terminal state t, note first that for a given length  max, Equation (2) shows that the estimate p[t] is an unbiased estimator. Now, for any random-trajectory Tk, we have that the score St,k obeys: (i) E[St,k]  p[t] and (ii) St,k  [0, r]; the first inequality again follows from Equation (2), while the second follows from the fact that we executed
REVERSE-PUSH operations until all residual values were less than r.

Now consider the rescaled random variable Xk = St,k/( r) and X = k[nf ] Xk; then we
have that Xk  [0, 1], E[X]  (nf / r)p[t] and also (X - E[X]) = (nf / r)(p[t] - p[t]). Moreover, using standard Chernoff bounds (cf. Theorem 1.1 in [9]), we have that:

P [|X - E[X]| > E[X]] < 2 exp

- 2E[X] 3

and P[X > b]  2-b for any b > 2eE[X]

Now we consider two cases:

1. E[St,k] > /2e (i.e., E[X] > nf /2e r = c/2e): Here, we can use the first concentration bound to get:

P

p[t] - p[t]  p[t] = P |X - E[X]|

where we use that nf = c maxr/ (cf. Algorithm 2). Moreover, by the union bound, we have:


P

p[t] - p[t]  p[t]   2 max exp

- 2c 32e

,

Now as long as c  6e/ 2 ln (2 max/pf ), we get the desired failure probability.
2. E[St,k] < /2e (i.e., E[X] < c/2e): In this case, note first that since X > 0, we have that p[t] - p[t]  (nf / r)E[X]  /2e < . On the other hand, we also have:

P

p[t] - p[t]  

=P

X

-

E[X ]



nf  r

 P [X  c]  2-c,

where the last inequality follows from our second concentration bound, which holds since we have c > 2eE[X]. Now as before, we can use the union bound to show that the failure probability is bounded by pf as long as c  log2 ( max/pf ).
Combining the two cases, we see that as long as c  max 6e/ 2, 1/ ln 2 ln (2 max/pf ), then we
have P  max p[t] - p[t]  max{, p[t]}  pf .

One aspect that is not obvious from the intuition in Section 2.2 or the accuracy analysis is if using a bidirectional method actually improves the running time of MSTP-estimation. This is addressed by the following result, which shows that for typical targets, our algorithm achieves significant speedup:

Theorem 2. Let any Markov chain P , source distribution , maximum length max and parameters

Reverse-work (i.e., for REVERSE-PUSH operations): Let Tr denote the reverse-work runtime for a uniform random choice of t  S. Then we have:

1 E[Tr] = |S|

max
(din(v) + 1)1{REVERSE-PUSH(v,k) is executed}

tS k=0 vS

Now for a given t  S and k  {0, 1, . . . , max}, note that the only states v  S on which we execute REVERSE-PUSH(v, k) are those with residual rkt (v) > r - consequently, for these states, we have that qkt (v) > r, and hence, by Equation (3), we have that pkev [t]  r (by setting  = ev,
i.e., starting from state v). Moreover, a REVERSE-PUSH(v, k) operation involves updating the residuals for din(v) + 1 states. Note that tS pkev [t] = 1 and hence, via a straightforward counting argument, we have that for any v  S, tS 1{pkev [t]r}  1/r. Thus, we have:

3 Applications of MSTP estimation

* Estimating the Stationary Distribution and Hitting Probabilities: MSTP-estimation can be
used in two ways to estimate stationary probabilities [t]. First, if we know the mixing time mix of the chain P , we can directly use Algorithm 2 to approximate [t] by setting max = mix and using any source distribution . Theorem 2 then guarantees that we can estimate a stationary

probability of order  in time O(m3/i2x d/). In comparison, Monte Carlo has O(mix/) run-
time. We note that in practice, we usually do not know the mixing time - in such a setting, our
algorithm can be used to compute an estimate of p[t] for all values of  max. An alternative is to modify Algorithm 2 to estimate the truncated hitting time p,hit[t](i.e., the probability of hitting t starting from  for the first time in steps). By setting  = et, we get an estimate for the expected truncated return time E[Tt1{Tt ]max} =  max pe,thit[t]. Now, using that fact that [t] = 1/E[Tt], we can get a lower bound for [t] which converges to [t] as max  . We note also that the truncated hitting time has been shown to be useful in other
applications such as identifying similar documents on a document-word-author graph [10].

To estimate the truncated hitting time, we modify Algorithm 2 as follows: at each stage i  {1, 2, . . . , max} (note: not i = 0), instead of REVERSE-PUSH(t, i), we update qit[t] = qit[t] + rit[t], set rit[t] = 0 and do not push back rit[t] to the in-neighbors of t in the (i + 1)th stage. The remaining algorithm remains the same. It is easy to see from the discussion in Section 2.2 that the resulting quantity p,hit[t] is an unbiased estimate of P[Hitting time of t = |X0  ] - we omit a formal proof due to lack of space.

* Exact Stationary Probabilities in Strong Doeblin chains: A strong Doeblin chain [11] is ob-

tained by mixing a Markov chain P and a distribution  as follows: at each transition, the pro-

cess proceeds according to P with probability , else samples a state from . Doeblin chains are

widely used in ML applications - special cases include the celebrated PageRank metric [12], vari-

ants such as HITS and SALSA [13], and other algorithms for applications such as ranking [14] and

structured prediction [15]. An important property of these chains is that if we sample a starting

node V0 from  and sample a trajectory of length Geometric() starting from V0, then the termi-

nal node is an unbiased sample from the stationary distribution [16]. There are two ways in which

our algorithm can be used for this purpose: one is to replace the REVERSE-PUSH algorithm with

a corresponding local update algorithm for the strong Doeblin chain (similar to the one in Ander-

sen et al. [4] for PageRank), and then sample random trajectories of length Geometric(). A

more direct technique is to choose some max >> 1/, estimate {p[t]}   [ max] and then

directly compute the stationary distribution as p[t] =

diffusions [17] and are used in a variety of applications. The case where i = i-1(1 - )

corresponds to PageRank. If instead the length is drawn according to a Poisson distribution

(i.e., i = e-i/i!), then the resulting function is called the heat-kernel h(G, ) - this too

has several applications, including finding communities (clusters) in large networks [5]. Note

ciently estimate these truncated sums. We perform numerical experiments on heat kernel estima-

tion in the next section.

* Conductance Testing in Graphs: MSTP-estimation is an essential primitive for conductance testing in large Markov chains [1]. In particular, in regular undirected graphs, Kale et al [6] develop a sublinear bidirectional estimator based on counting collisions between walks in order to identify `weak' nodes - those which belong to sets with small conductance. Our algorithm can be used to extend this process to any graph, including weighted and directed graphs.

* Local Algorithms: There is a lot of interest recently on local algorithms - those which perform computations given only a small neighborhood of a source node [18]. In this regard, we note that Bidirectional-MSTP gives a natural local algorithm for MSTP estimation, and thus for the applications mentioned above - given a k-hop neighborhood around the source and target, we can perform Bidirectional-MSTP with max set to k. The proof of this follows from the fact that the invariant in Equation (2) holds after any sequence of REVERSE-PUSH operations.

Figure 2: Estimating heat kernels: Bidirectional MSTP-estimation vs. Monte Carlo, Forward Push. To compare runtimes, we choose parameters such that the mean relative error of all algorithms is around 10%. Notice that Bidirectional-MSTP is 100 times faster than the other algorithms.
4 Experiments
To demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on large Markov chains, we use heat kernel estimation (cf. Section 3) as an example application. The heat kernel is a non-homogenous Markov chain, defined as the probability of stopping at the target on a random walk from the source, where the walk length is sampled from a P oisson( ) Distribution. In real-world graphs, a heat-kernel value between a pair of nodes has been shown to be a good indicator of an underlying community relationship [5] - this suggests that it can serve as a metric for personalized search on social networks. For example, if a social network user s wants to view a list of users attending some event, then sorting these users by heat kernel values will result in the most similar users to s appearing on top. Bidirectional-MSTP is ideal for such personalized search applications, as the set of users filtered by a search query is typically much smaller than the set of nodes on the network.
In Figure 2, we compare the runtime of different algorithms for heat kernel computation on four real-world graphs, ranging from millions to billions of edges 3. For each graph, for random (source, target) pairs, we compute the heat kernel using Bidirectional-MSTP, as well as two benchmark algorithms - Monte Carlo, and the Forward Push algorithm (as presented in [5]). All three algorithms have parameters which allow them to trade off speed and accuracy - for a fair comparison, we choose parameters such that the empirical mean relative error each algorithm is 10%. All three algorithms were implemented in Scala - for the forward push algorithm, our implementation follows the code linked from [5]).
We set average walk-length = 5(since longer walks will mix into the stationary distribution), and set the maximum length to + 10  27; the probability of a walk being longer than this is 10-12, which is negligible. For reproducibility, our source code is available on our website (cf. [8]).
Figure 2 shows that across all graphs, Bidirectional-MSTP is 100x faster than the two benchmark algorithms. For example, on the Twitter graph, it can estimate a heat kernel score is 0.1 seconds, while the the other algorithms take more than 4 minutes. We note though that Monte Carlo and Forward Push can return scores from the source to all targets, rather than just one target - thus Bidirectional-MSTP is most useful when we want the score for a small set of targets.

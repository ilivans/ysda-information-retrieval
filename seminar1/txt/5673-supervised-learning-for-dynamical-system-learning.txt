Abstract
Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dynamical systems. These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoff between computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporate prior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we present a new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, thereby allowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such as L1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this new framework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regression or lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does; the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis.

1 Introduction
Likelihood-based approaches to learning dynamical systems, such as EM [1] and MCMC [2], can be slow and suffer from local optima. This difficulty has resulted in the development of so-called "spectral algorithms" [3], which rely on factorization of a matrix of observable moments; these algorithms are often fast, simple, and globally optimal.
Despite these advantages, spectral algorithms fall short in one important aspect compared to EM and MCMC: the latter two methods are meta-algorithms or frameworks that offer a clear template for developing new instances incorporating various forms of prior knowledge. For spectral algorithms, by contrast, there is no clear template to go from a set of probabilistic assumptions to an algorithm. In fact, researchers often relax model assumptions to make the algorithm design process easier, potentially discarding valuable information in the process.
To address this problem, we propose a new framework for dynamical system learning, using the idea of instrumental-variable regression [4, 5] to transform dynamical system learning to a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems. This transformation allows us to apply the rich literature on supervised learning to incorporate many types of prior knowledge. Our new methods subsume a variety of existing spectral algorithms as special cases.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: first we formulate the new learning framework (Sec. 2). We then provide theoretical guarantees for the proposed methods (Sec. 4). Finally, we give two examples of how our techniques let us rapidly design new and useful dynamical system learning methods by encoding modeling assumptions (Sec. 5).

2 A framework for spectral algorithms
A dynamical system is a stochastic process (i.e., a distribution over sequences of observations) such that, at any time, the distribution of future observations is fully determined by a vector st called the latent state. The process is specified by three distributions: the initial state distribution P (s1), the state transition distribution P (st+1 | st), and the observation distribution P (ot | st). For later use, we write the observation ot as a function of the state st and random noise t, as shown in Figure 1.
Given a dynamical system, one of the fundamental tasks is to perform inference, where we predict future observations given a history of observations. Typically this is accomplished by maintaining a distribution or belief over states bt|t-1 = P (st | o1:t-1) where o1:t-1 denotes the first t - 1 observations. bt|t-1 represents both our knowledge and our uncertainty about the true state of the system. Two core inference tasks are filtering and prediction.1 In filtering, given the current belief bt = bt|t-1 and a new observation ot, we calculate an updated belief bt+1 = bt+1|t that incorporates ot. In prediction, we project our belief into the future: given a belief bt|t-1 we estimate bt+k|t-1 = P (st+k | o1:t-1) for some k > 0 (without incorporating any intervening observations).
The typical approach for learning a dynamical system is to explicitly learn the initial, transition, and observation distributions by maximum likelihood. Spectral algorithms offer an alternate approach to learning: they instead use the method of moments to set up a system of equations that can be solved in closed form to recover estimates of the desired parameters. In this process, they typically factorize a matrix or tensor of observed moments--hence the name "spectral."
Spectral algorithms often (but not always [6]) avoid explicitly estimating the latent state or the initial, transition, or observation distributions; instead they recover observable operators that can be used to perform filtering and prediction directly. To do so, they use an observable representation: instead of maintaining a belief bt over states st, they maintain the expected value of a sufficient statistic of future observations. Such a representation is often called a (transformed) predictive state [7].
In more detail, we define qt = qt|t-1 = E[t | o1:t-1], where t = (ot:t+k-1) is a vector of future features. The features are chosen such that qt determines the distribution of future observations P (ot:t+k-1 | o1:t-1).2 Filtering then becomes the process of mapping a predictive state qt to qt+1 conditioned on ot, while prediction maps a predictive state qt = qt|t-1 to qt+k|t-1 = E[t+k | o1:t-1] without intervening observations.
1There are other forms of inference in addition to filtering and prediction, such as smoothing and likelihood evaluation, but they are outside the scope of this paper.
2For convenience we assume that the system is k-observable: that is, the distribution of all future observations is determined by the distribution of the next k observations. (Note: not by the next k observations themselves.) At the cost of additional notation, this restriction could easily be lifted.
2

A typical way to derive a spectral method is to select a set of moments involving t, work out the expected values of these moments in terms of the observable operators, then invert this relationship to get an equation for the observable operators in terms of the moments. We can then plug in an empirical estimate of the moments to compute estimates of the observable operators.

While effective, this approach can be statistically inefficient (the goal of being able to solve for the observable operators is in conflict with the goal of maximizing statistical efficiency) and can make it difficult to incorporate prior information (each new source of information leads to new moments and a different and possibly harder set of equations to solve). To address these problems, we show that we can instead learn the observable operators by solving three supervised learning problems.

The main idea is that, just as we can represent a belief about a latent state st as the conditional expectation of a vector of observable statistics, we can also represent any other distributions needed for prediction and filtering via their own vectors of observable statistics. Given such a representation, we can learn to filter and predict by learning how to map these vectors to one another.

In particular, the key intermediate quantity for filtering is the "extended and marginalized" belief
P (ot, st+1 | o1:t-1)--or equivalently P (ot:t+k | o1:t-1). We represent this distribution via a vector t = (ot:t+k) of features of the extended future. The features are chosen such that the extended state pt = E[t | o1:t-1] determines P (ot:t+k | o1:t-1). Given P (ot:t+k | o1:t-1), filtering and prediction reduce respectively to conditioning on and marginalizing over ot.

In many models (including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Kalman filters), the extended state

pt is linearly related to the predictive state qt--a property we exploit for our framework. That is,

pt = W qt

(1)

for some linear operator W . For example, in a discrete system t can be an indicator vector repre-
senting the joint assignment of the next k observations, and t can be an indicator vector for the next k + 1 observations. The matrix W is then the conditional probability table P (ot:t+k | ot:t+k-1).

Our goal, therefore, is to learn this mapping W . Naively, we might try to use linear regression for
this purpose, substituting samples of t and t in place of qt and pt since we cannot observe qt or pt directly. Unfortunately, due to the overlap between observation windows, the noise terms on t and t are correlated. So, naive linear regression will give a biased estimate of W .

To counteract this bias, we employ instrumental regression [4, 5]. Instrumental regression uses instrumental variables that are correlated with the input qt but not with the noise t:t+k. This property provides a criterion to denoise the inputs and outputs of the original regression problem: we remove
that part of the input/output that is not correlated with the instrumental variables. In our case, since past observations o1:t-1 do not overlap with future or extended future windows, they are not correlated with the noise t:t+k+1, as can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, we can use history features ht = h(o1:t-1) as instrumental variables.

In more detail, by taking the expectation of (1) given ht, we obtain an instrument-based moment condition: for all t,

E[pt | ht] = E[W qt | ht]

E[E[t | o1:t-1] | ht] = W E[E[t | o1:t-1] | ht]

E[t | ht] = W E[t | ht]

(2)

Assuming that there are enough independent dimensions in ht that are correlated with qt, we maintain the rank of the moment condition when moving from (1) to (2), and we can recover W by least squares regression if we can compute E[t | ht] and E[t | ht] for sufficiently many examples t.

Fortunately, conditional expectations such as E[t | ht] are exactly what supervised learning algorithms are designed to compute. So, we arrive at our learning framework: we first use supervised learning to estimate E[t | ht] and E[t | ht], effectively denoising the training examples, and then use these estimates to compute W by finding the least squares solution to (2).

In summary, learning and inference of a dynamical system through instrumental regression can be described as follows:

* Model Specification: Pick features of history ht = h(o1:t-1), future t = (ot:t+k-1) and extended future t = (ot:t+k). t must be a sufficient statistic for P(ot:t+k-1 |
o1:t-1). t must satisfy

* Initial State Estimation: Estimate an initial state q1 = E[1] by averaging 1 across several example realizations of our time series.4
* Inference: Starting from the initial state q1, we can maintain the predictive state qt = E[t | o1:t-1] through filtering: given qt we compute pt = E[t | o1:t-1] = W qt. Then, given the observation ot, we can compute qt+1 = ffilter(pt, ot). Or, in the absence of ot, we can predict the next state qt+1|t-1 = fpredict(pt). Finally, by definition, the predictive state qt is sufficient to compute P(ot:t+k-1 | o1:t-1).5
The process of learning and inference is depicted in Figure 2. Modeling assumptions are reflected in the choice of the statistics ,  and h as well as the regression models in stages S1A and S1B. Table 1 demonstrates that we can recover existing spectral algorithms for dynamical system learning using linear S1 regression. In addition to providing a unifying view of some successful learning algorithms, the new framework also paves the way for extending these algorithms in a theoretically justified manner, as we demonstrate in the experiments below.

3 Related Work

This work extends predictive state learning algorithms for dynamical systems, which include spectral algorithms for Kalman filters [11], Hidden Markov Models [3, 12], Predictive State Representations (PSRs) [13, 14] and Weighted Automata [15]. It also extends kernel variants such as [9], which builds on [16]. All of the above work effectively uses linear regression or linear ridge regression (although not always in an obvious way).

3Our bounds assume that the training time steps t are sufficiently spaced for the underlying process to mix,

but in practice, the error will only get smaller if we consider all time steps t.

5It might seem reasonable to learn qt+1 = fcombined(qt, ot) directly, thereby avoiding the need to separately

estimate pt and condition on ot. Unfortunately, fcombined is nonlinear for common models such as HMMs.

One common aspect of predictive state learning algorithms is that they exploit the covariance structure between future and past observation sequences to obtain an unbiased observable state representation. Boots and Gordon [17] note the connection between this covariance and (linear) instrumental regression in the context of the HSE-HMM. We use this connection to build a general framework for dynamical system learning where the state space can be identified using arbitrary (possibly nonlinear) supervised learning methods. This generalization lets us incorporate prior knowledge to learn compact or regularized models; our experiments demonstrate that this flexibility lets us take better advantage of limited data.
Reducing the problem of learning dynamical systems with latent state to supervised learning bears similarity to Langford et al.'s sufficient posterior representation (SPR) [18], which encodes the state by the sufficient statistics of the conditional distribution of the next observation and represents system dynamics by three vector-valued functions that are estimated using supervised learning approaches. While SPR allows all of these functions to be non-linear, it involves a rather complicated training procedure involving multiple iterations of model refinement and model averaging, whereas our framework only requires solving three regression problems in sequence. In addition, the theoretical analysis of [18] only establishes the consistency of SPR learning assuming that all regression steps are solved perfectly. Our work, on the other hand, establishes convergence rates based on the performance of S1 regression.

4 Theoretical Analysis

In this section we present error bounds for two-stage instrumental regression. These bounds hold regardless of the particular S1 regression method used, assuming that the S1 predictions converge to the true conditional expectations. The bounds imply that our overall method is consistent.
Let (xt, yt, zt)  (X , Y, Z) be i.i.d. triplets of input, output, and instrumental variables. (Lack of independence will result in slower convergence in proportion to the mixing time of our process.) Let xt and yt denote E[xt | zt] and E[yt | zt]. And, let xt and yt denote E[xt | zt] and E[yt | zt] as estimated by the S1A and S1B regression steps. Here xt, xt  X and yt, yt  Y.
We want to analyze the convergence of the output of S2 regression--that is, of the weights W given by ridge regression between S1A outputs and S1B outputs:

W  =

yt  xt
t=1

(3)

Here  denotes tensor (outer) product, and  > 0 is a regularization parameter that ensures the invertibility of the estimated covariance.

Before we state our main theorem we need to quantify the quality of S1 regression in a way that is independent of the S1 functional form. To do so, we place a bound on the S1 error, and assume that this bound converges to zero: given the definition below, for each fixed , limN ,N = 0.
Definition 1 (S1 Regression Bound). For any  > 0 and N  N+, the S1 regression bound ,N > 0 is a number such that, with probability at least (1 - /2), for all 1  t  N :

xt - xt X < ,N yt - yt Y < ,N

In many applications, X , Y and Z will be finite dimensional real vector spaces: Rdx , Rdy and Rdz . However, for generality we state our results in terms of arbitrary reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In this case S2 uses kernel ridge regression, leading to methods such as HSE-PSRs. For this purpose, let xx and yy denote the (uncentered) covariance operators of x and y respectively:
xx = E[x  x], yy = E[y  y]. And, let R(xx) denote the closure of the range of xx.
With the above assumptions, Theorem 2 gives a generic error bound on S2 regression in terms of S1 regression. If X and Y are finite dimensional and xx has full rank, then using ordinary least squares (i.e., setting  = 0) will give the same bound, but with  in the first two terms replaced by the minimum eigenvalue of xx, and the last term dropped.

We defer the proof to the supplementary material. The supplementary material also provides explicit finite-sample bounds (including expressions for the constants hidden by O-notation), as well as concrete examples of S1 regression bounds ,N for practical regression models.
Theorem 2 assumes that xtest is in R(xx). For dynamical systems, all valid states satisfy this property. However, with finite data, estimation errors may cause the estimated state qt (i.e., xtest) to have a non-zero component in R(xx). Lemma 3 bounds the effect of such errors: it states that, in a stable system, this component gets smaller as S1 regression performs better. The main limitation of Lemma 3 is the assumption that ffilter is L-Lipchitz, which essentially means that the model's estimated probability for ot is bounded below. There is no way to guarantee this property in practice; so, Lemma 3 provides suggestive evidence rather than a guarantee that our learned dynamical system will predict well.
Lemma 3. For observations o1:T , let qt be the estimated state given o1:t-1. Let qt be the projection of qt onto R(xx). Assume ffilter is L-Lipchitz on pt when evaluated at ot, and ffilter(pt, ot)  R(xx) for any pt  R(yy). Given the assumptions of theorem 2 and assuming that qt X  R for all 1  t  T , the following holds for all 1  t  T with probability at least 1 - /2.

t X = qt - qt X = O ,N 
Since W  is bounded, the prediction error due to t diminishes at the same rate as

t X.

5 Experiments and Results
We now demonstrate examples of tweaking the S1 regression to gain advantage. In the first experiment we show that nonlinear regression can be used to reduce the number of parameters needed in S1, thereby improving statistical performance for learning an HMM. In the second experiment we show that we can encode prior knowledge as regularization.

5.1 Learning A Knowledge Tracing Model
In this experiment we attempt to model and predict the performance of students learning from an interactive computer-based tutor. We use the Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) model [19], which is essentially a 2-state HMM: the state st represents whether a student has learned a knowledge component (KC), and the observation ot represents the success/failure of solving the tth question in a sequence of questions that cover this KC. Figure 3 summarizes the model. The events denoted by guessing, slipping, learning and forgetting typically have relatively low probabilities.
5.1.1 Data Description
We evaluate the model using the "Geometry Area (1996-97)" data available from DataShop [20]. This data was generated by students learning introductory geometry, and contains attempts by 59 students in 12 knowledge components. As is typical for BKT, we consider a student's attempt at a question to be correct iff the student entered the correct answer on the first try, without requesting any hints from the help system. Each training sequence consists of a sequence of first attempts for a student/KC pair. We discard sequences of length less than 5, resulting in a total of 325 sequences.

5.1.2 Models and Evaluation
Under the (reasonable) assumption that the two states have distinct observation probabilities, this model is 1-observable. Hence we define the predictive state to be the expected next observation, which results in the following statistics: t = ot and t = ot k ot+1, where ot is represented by a 2 dimensional indicator vector and k denotes the Kronecker product. Given these statistics, the extended state pt = E[t | o1:t-1] is a joint probability table of ot:t+1.
We compare three models that differ by history features and S1 regression method:
Spec-HMM: This baseline uses ht = ot-1 and linear S1 regression, making it equivalent to the spectral HMM method of [3], as detailed in the supplementary material.
Feat-HMM: This baseline represents ht by an indicator vector of the joint assignment of the previous b observations (we set b to 4) and uses linear S1 regression. This is essentially a feature-based spectral HMM [12]. It thus incorporates more history information compared to Spec-HMM at the expense of increasing the number of S1 parameters by O(2b).
LR-HMM: This model represents ht by a binary vector of length b encoding the previous b observations and uses logistic regression as the S1 model. Thus, it uses the same history information as Feat-HMM but reduces the number of parameters to O(b) at the expense of inductive bias.
We evaluated the above models using 1000 random splits of the 325 sequences into 200 training and 125 testing. For each testing observation ot we compute the absolute error between actual and expected value (i.e. |ot=1 - P(ot = 1 | o1:t-1)|). We report the mean absolute error for each split. The results are displayed in Figure 4.6 We see that, while incorporating more history information increases accuracy (Feat-HMM vs. Spec-HMM), being able to incorporate the same information using a more compact model gives an additional gain in accuracy (LR-HMM vs. Feat-HMM). We also compared the LR-HMM method to an HMM trained using expectation maximization (EM). We found that the LR-HMM model is much faster to train than EM while being on par with it in terms of prediction error.7
5.2 Modeling Independent Subsystems Using Lasso Regression
Spectral algorithms for Kalman filters typically use the left singular vectors of the covariance between history and future features as a basis for the state space. However, this basis hides any sparsity that might be present in our original basis. In this experiment, we show that we can instead use lasso (without dimensionality reduction) as our S1 regression algorithm to discover sparsity. This is useful, for example, when the system consists of multiple independent subsystems, each of which affects a subset of the observation coordinates.
To test this idea we generate a sequence of 30-dimensional observations from a Kalman filter. Observation dimensions 1 through 10 and 11 through 20 are generated from two independent subsystems of state dimension 5. Dimensions 21-30 are generated from white noise. Each subsystem's transition and observation matrices have random Gaussian coordinates, with the transition matrix scaled
6The differences have similar sign but smaller magnitude if we use RMSE instead of MAE. 7We used MATLAB's built-in logistic regression and EM functions.

We estimate the state space basis using 1000 examples (assuming 1-observability) and compare the singular vectors of the past to future regression matrix to those obtained from the Lasso regression matrix. The result is shown in figure 5. Clearly, using Lasso as stage 1 regression results in a basis that better matches the structure of the underlying system.
6 Conclusion
In this work we developed a general framework for dynamical system learning using supervised learning methods. The framework relies on two key principles: first, we extend the idea of predictive state to include extended state as well, allowing us to represent all of inference in terms of predictions of observable features. Second, we use past features as instruments in an instrumental regression, denoising state estimates that then serve as training examples to estimate system dynamics.
We have shown that this framework encompasses and provides a unified view of some previous successful dynamical system learning algorithms. We have also demostrated that it can be used to extend existing algorithms to incorporate nonlinearity and regularizers, resulting in better state estimates. As future work, we would like to apply this framework to leverage additional techniques such as manifold embedding and transfer learning in stage 1 regression. We would also like to extend the framework to controlled processes.

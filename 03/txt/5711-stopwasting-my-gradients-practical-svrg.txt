Abstract
We present and analyze several strategies for improving the performance of stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods. We first show that the convergence rate of these methods can be preserved under a decreasing sequence of errors in the control variate, and use this to derive variants of SVRG that use growing-batch strategies to reduce the number of gradient calculations required in the early iterations. We further (i) show how to exploit support vectors to reduce the number of gradient computations in the later iterations, (ii) prove that the commonly-used regularized SVRG iteration is justified and improves the convergence rate, (iii) consider alternate mini-batch selection strategies, and (iv) consider the generalization error of the method.

1 Introduction

We consider the problem of optimizing the average of a finite but large sum of smooth functions,

1n

min
xRd

f (x)

=

n

i=1

fi(x).

(1)

A huge proportion of the model-fitting procedures in machine learning can be mapped to this problem. This includes classic models like least squares and logistic regression but also includes more advanced methods like conditional random fields and deep neural network models. In the highdimensional setting (large d), the traditional approaches for solving (1) are: full gradient (FG) methods which have linear convergence rates but need to evaluate the gradient fi for all n examples on every iteration, and stochastic gradient (SG) methods which make rapid initial progress as they only use a single gradient on each iteration but ultimately have slower sublinear convergence rates.

Le Roux et al. [1] proposed the first general method, stochastic average gradient (SAG), that only
considers one training example on each iteration but still achieves a linear convergence rate. Other
methods have subsequently been shown to have this property [2, 3, 4], but these all require storing a
previous evaluation of the gradient fi or the dual variables for each i. For many objectives this only requires O(n) space, but for general problems this requires O(np) space making them impractical.

Recently, several methods have been proposed with similar convergence rates to SAG but without the memory requirements [5, 6, 7, 8]. They are known as mixed gradient, stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG), and semi-stochastic gradient methods (we will use SVRG). We give a canonical SVRG algorithm in the next section, but the salient features of these methods are that they evaluate two gradients on each iteration and occasionally must compute the gradient on all examples. SVRG

methods often dramatically outperform classic FG and SG methods, but these extra evaluations mean that SVRG is slower than SG methods in the important early iterations. They also mean that SVRG methods are typically slower than memory-based methods like SAG.
In this work we first show that SVRG is robust to inexact calculation of the full gradients it requires (3), provided the accuracy increases over time. We use this to explore growing-batch strategies that require fewer gradient evaluations when far from the solution, and we propose a mixed SG/SVRG method that may improve performance in the early iterations (4). We next explore using support vectors to reduce the number of gradients required when close to the solution (5), give a justification for the regularized SVRG update that is commonly used in practice (6), consider alternative minibatch strategies (7), and finally consider the generalization error of the method (8).

2 Notation and SVRG Algorithm

SVRG assumes f is -strongly convex, each fi is convex, and each gradient fi is Lipschitzcontinuous with constant L. The method begins with an initial estimate x0, sets x0 = x0 and then generates a sequence of iterates xt using

xt = xt-1 - (fit (xt-1) - fit (xs) + s),

(2)

where  is the positive step size, we set s = f (xs), and it is chosen uniformly from {1, 2, . . . , n}. After every m steps, we set xs+1 = xt for a random t  {1, . . . , m}, and we reset t = 0 with x0 = xs+1.

To analyze the convergence rate of SVRG, we will find it convenient to define the function

11

(a, b) = 1 - 2a

+ 2b . m

as it appears repeatedly in our results. We will use (a) to indicate the value of (a, b) when a = b, and we will simply use  for the special case when a = b = L. Johnson & Zhang [6] show that if  and m are chosen such that 0 <  < 1, the algorithm achieves a linear convergence rate of the form
E[f (xs+1) - f (x)]  E[f (xs) - f (x)],
where x is the optimal solution. This convergence rate is very fast for appropriate  and m. While this result relies on constants we may not know in general, practical choices with good empirical performance include setting m = n,  = 1/L, and using xs+1 = xm rather than a random iterate.

Unfortunately, the SVRG algorithm requires 2m + n gradient evaluations for every m iterations of (2), since updating xt requires two gradient evaluations and computing s require n gradient evaluations. We can reduce this to m + n if we store the gradients fi (xs), but this is not practical in most applications. Thus, SVRG requires many more gradient evaluations than classic SG iterations
of memory-based methods like SAG.

3 SVRG with Error

We first give a result for the SVRG method where we assume that s is equal to f (xs) up to some error es. This is in the spirit of the analysis of [9], who analyze FG methods under similar assumptions. We assume that xt - x  Z for all t, which has been used in related work [10] and
is reasonable because of the coercity implied by strong-convexity.

Proposition 1. If s = f (xs) + es and we set  and m so that  < 1, then the SVRG algorithm (2) with xs+1 chosen randomly from {x1, x2, . . . , xm} satisfies

E[f (xs+1) - f (x)]  E[f (xs) - f (x)] + ZE

es + E 1 - 2L

es

2
.

We give the proof in Appendix A. This result implies that SVRG does not need a very accurate approximation of f (xs) in the crucial early iterations since the first term in the bound will dominate.
Further, this result implies that we can maintain the exact convergence rate of SVRG as long as the errors es decrease at an appropriate rate. For example, we obtain the same convergence rate provided that max{E es , E es 2}  s for any   0 and some  < . Further, we still obtain a linear convergence rate as long as es converges to zero with a linear convergence rate.

3.1 Non-Uniform Sampling

Xiao & Zhang [11] show that non-uniform sampling (NUS) improves the performance of SVRG.

They assume

L

each fi is Li-Lipschitz continuous, Li. The iteration is then changed to

which maintains that the search direction is unbiased. In Appendix A, we show that if s is computed with error for this algorithm and if we set  and m so that 0 < (L) < 1, then we have a convergence

rate of

E[f (xs+1) - f (x)]  (L)E[f (xs) - f (x)] + ZE

es + E 1 - 2L

,

which can be faster since the average L may be much smaller than the maximum value L.

3.2 SVRG with Batching

There are many ways we could allow an error in the calculation of s to speed up the algorithm. For
example, if evaluating each fi involves solving an optimization problem, then we could solve this optimization problem inexactly. For example, if we are fitting a graphical model with an iterative
approximate inference method, we can terminate the iterations early to save time.

When the fi are simple but n is large, a natural way to approximate s is with a subset (or `batch') of training examples Bs (chosen without replacement),

s

=

1 |Bs|

fi (xs).

iBs

The batch size |Bs| controls the error in the approximation, and we can drive the error to zero by increasing it to n. Existing SVRG methods correspond to the special case where |Bs| = n for all s.

Algorithm 1 gives pseudo-code for an SVRG implementation that uses this sub-sampling strategy. If we assume that the sample variance of the norms of the gradients is bounded by S2 for all xs,

1n n-1

fi (xs) 2 - f (xs) 2  S2,

i=1

then we have that [12, Chapter 2]

So if we want E es 2  2s, where   0 is a constant for some  < 1, we need

and the convergence rate of SVRG is unchanged compared to using the full batch on all iterations.

The condition (3) guarantees a linear convergence rate under any exponentially-increasing sequence

of batch sizes, the strategy suggested by [13] for classic SG methods. However, a tedious calculation

shows that (3) has an inflection point at s = log(S2/n)/2 log(1/), corresponding to |Bs| =

This

was

4 Mixed SG and SVRG Method

An approximate s can drastically reduce the computational cost of the SVRG algorithm, but does not affect the 2 in the 2m+n gradients required for m SVRG iterations. This factor of 2 is significant in the early iterations, since this is when stochastic methods make the most progress and when we typically see the largest reduction in the test error.

To reduce this factor, we can consider a mixed strategy: if it is in the batch Bs then perform an SVRG iteration, but if it is not in the current batch then use a classic SG iteration. We illustrate this modification in Algorithm 2. This modification allows the algorithm to take advantage of the rapid
initial progress of SG, since it predominantly uses SG iterations when far from the solution. Below
we give a convergence rate for this mixed strategy.

Proposition 2. Let s = f (xs)+es and we set  and m so that 0 < (L, L) < 1 with  = |Bs|/n. If we assume E fi (x) 2  2 then Algorithm 2 has

E[f (xs+1) - f (x)]  (L, L)E[f (xs) - f (x)] + ZE es

+ E

es

2

+

2 2

)

1 - 2L

We give the proof in Appendix B. The extra term depending on the variance 2 is typically the bottleneck for SG methods. Classic SG methods require the step-size  to converge to zero because of this term. However, the mixed SG/SVRG method can keep the fast progress from using a constant  since the term depending on 2 converges to zero as  converges to one. Since  < 1 implies that (L, L) < , this result implies that when [f (xs) - f (x)] is large compared to es and 2 that the mixed SG/SVRG method actually converges faster.
Sharing a single step size  between the SG and SVRG iterations in Proposition 2 is sub-optimal. For example, if x is close to x and |Bs|  n, then the SG iteration might actually take us far away from the minimizer. Thus, we may want to use a decreasing sequence of step sizes for the SG iterations. In Appendix B, we show that using  = O( (n - |B|)/n|B|) for the SG iterations can improve the dependence on the error es and variance 2.

5 Using Support Vectors
Using a batch Bs decreases the number of gradient evaluations required when SVRG is far from the solution, but its benefit diminishes over time. However, for certain objectives we can further

4

Algorithm 3 Heuristic for skipping evaluations of fi at x

if ski = 0 then
compute fi (x). if fi (x) = 0 then
psi = psi + 1. ski = 2max{0,psi-2}.
else

{Update the number of consecutive times fi (x) was zero.} {Skip exponential number of future evaluations if it remains zero.}

psi = 0. end if

{This could be a support vector, do not skip it next time.}

return fi (x). else

ski = ski - 1. return 0.

{In this case, we skip the evaluation.}

end if

reduce the number of gradient evaluations by identifying support vectors. For example, consider minimizing the Huberized hinge loss (HSVM) with threshold [15],

min
xRd

1 n

n i=1

f (biaTi x),

 0 
f ( ) = 1 - 
 (1+ - )2 
4

if  > 1 + , if  < 1 - ,
if |1 -  |  ,

In terms of (1), we have fi(x) = f (biaTi x). The performance of this loss function is similar to logistic regression and the hinge loss, but it has the appealing properties of both: it is differentiable like logistic regression meaning we can apply methods like SVRG, but it has support vectors like the hinge loss meaning that many examples will have fi(x) = 0 and fi (x) = 0. We can also construct Huberized variants of many non-smooth losses for regression and multi-class classification.
If we knew the support vectors where fi(x) > 0, we could solve the problem faster by ignoring the non-support vectors. For example, if there are 100000 training examples but only 100 support vectors in the optimal solution, we could solve the problem 1000 times faster. While we typically don't know the support vectors, in this section we outline a heuristic that gives large practical improvements by trying to identify them as the algorithm runs.

Our heuristic has two components. The first component is maintaining the list of non-support vectors at xs. Specifically, we maintain a list of examples i where fi (xs) = 0. When SVRG picks an example it that is part of this list, we know that fit (xs) = 0 and thus the iteration only needs one gradient evaluation. This modification is not a heuristic, in that it still applies the exact SVRG algorithm. However, at best it can only cut the runtime in half.
The heuristic part of our strategy is to skip fi (xs) or fi (xt) if our evaluation of fi has been zero more than two consecutive times (and skipping it an exponentially larger number of times each time it remains zero). Specifically, for each example i we maintain two variables, ski (for `skip') and psi (for `pass'). Whenever we need to evaluate fi for some xs or xt, we run Algorithm 3 which may skip the evaluation. This strategy can lead to huge computational savings in later iterations if there are few support vectors, since many iterations will require no gradient evaluations.

Identifying support vectors to speed up computation has long been an important part of SVM solvers, and is related to the classic shrinking heuristic [16]. While it has previously been explored in the context of dual coordinate ascent methods [17], this is the first work exploring it for linearly-convergent stochastic gradient methods.

6 Regularized SVRG

We are often interested in the special case where problem (1) has the decomposition

1n

min
xRd

f (x)  h(x) +

n

gi(x).
i=1

5

(4)

A common choice of h is a scaled 1-norm of the parameter vector, h(x) =  x 1. This non-smooth regularizer encourages sparsity in the parameter vector, and can be addressed with the proximalSVRG method of Xiao & Zhang [11]. Alternately, if we want an explicit Z we could set h to the indicator function for a 2-norm ball containing x. In Appendix C, we give a variant of Proposition 1 that allows errors in the proximal-SVRG method for non-smooth/constrained settings like this.

Another common choice is the

2-regularizer, h(x)

=

 2

x 2.

With this regularizer, the SVRG

updates can be equivalently written in the form

xt+1 = xt -  h (xt) + git (xt) - git (xs) + s ,

(5)

where

s

=

1 n

n i=1

gi(xs).

That

is,

they

take

an

exact

gradient

step

with

respect

to

the

regularizer

and an SVRG step with respect to the gi functions. When the gi are sparse, this form of the update

allows us to implement the iteration without needing full-vector operations. A related update is used

by Le Roux et al. to avoid full-vector operations in the SAG algorithm [1, 4]. In Appendix C, we

prove the below convergence rate for this update.

Proposition 3. Consider instances of problem (1) that can be written in the form (4) where h is Lh-Lipschitz continuous and each gi is Lg-Lipschitz continuous, and assume that we set  and m so that 0 < (Lm) < 1 with Lm = max{Lg, Lh}. Then the regularized SVRG iteration (5) has
E[f (xs+1) - f (x)]  (Lm)E[f (xs) - f (x)],

Since Lm  L, and strictly so in the case of 2-regularization, this result shows that for 2regularized problems SVRG actually converges faster than the standard analysis would indicate (a similar result appears in Konecny et al. [18]). Further, this result gives a theoretical justification for using the update (5) for other h functions where it is not equivalent to the original SVRG method.

7 Mini-Batching Strategies

Konecny et al. [18] have also recently considered using batches of data within SVRG. They consider using `mini-batches' in the inner iteration (the update of xt) to decrease the variance of the method, but still use full passes through the data to compute s. This prior work is thus complimentary to the current work (in practice, both strategies can be used to improve performance). In Appendix D we show that sampling the inner mini-batch proportional to Li achieves a convergence rate of
E f (xs+1) - f (x)  M E [f (xs) - f (x)] ,

where M is the size of the mini-batch while

1 M = M - 2L

M + 2L m

,

and we assume 0 < M < 1. This generalizes the standard rate of SVRG and improves on the result of Konecny et al. [18] in the smooth case. This rate can be faster than the rate of the standard SVRG method at the cost of a more expensive iteration, and may be clearly advantageous in settings where parallel computation allows us to compute several gradients simultaneously.

The regularized SVRG form (5) suggests an alternate mini-batch strategy for problem (1): consider

a mini-batch that contains a `fixed' set Bf and a `random' set Bt. Without loss of generality, assume

that we sort the fi based on their Li values so that L1  L2  * * *  Ln. For the fixed Bf we will

always choose the Mf values with the largest Li, Bf = {f1, f2, . . . , fMf }. In contrast, we choose

the members of the random set Bt by sampling from Br = {fMf +1, . . . , fn} proportional to their

Lipschitz constants, pi

In

Appendix

D,

we

show

the

following convergence rate for this strategy:

Proposition 4. Let g(x) = (1/n) i/[Bf ] fi(x) and h(x) = (1/n) i[Bf ] fi(x). If we replace the SVRG update with

than

SVRG with a mini-batch of size M . The scenario where this rate is slower than the existing mini-

batch SVRG strategy is when L1  nL/M . But we could relax this assumption by dividing each

element of the fixed set Bf into two functions: fi and (1 - )fi, where  = 1/M , then replacing

each function fi in Bf with fi and adding (1 - )fi to the random set Br. This result may be

relevant if we have access to a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or graphical processing unit

(GPU) that can compute the gradient for a fixed subset of the examples very efficiently. However,

our experiments (Appendix F) indicate this strategy only gives marginal gains.

In Appendix F, we also consider constructing mini-batches by sampling proportional to fi(xs) or fi (xs) . These seemed to work as well as Lipschitz sampling on all but one of the datasets in our experiments, and this strategy is appealing because we have access to these values while we may
not know the Li values. However, these strategies diverged on one of the datasets.

8 Learning efficiency

In this section we compare the performance of SVRG as a large-scale learning algorithm compared to FG and SG methods. Following Bottou & Bousquet [19], we can formulate the generalization error E of a learning algorithm as the sum of three terms
E = Eapp + Eest + Eopt
where the approximation error Eapp measures the effect of using a limited class of models, the estimation error Eest measures the effect of using a finite training set, and the optimization error Eopt measures the effect of inexactly solving problem (1). Bottou & Bousquet [19] study asymptotic performance of various algorithms for a fixed approximation error and under certain conditions on the distribution of the data depending on parameters  or . In Appendix E, we discuss how SVRG can be analyzed in their framework. The table below includes SVRG among their results.

in their work we add a bias variable, normalize dense features, and set the regularization parameter  to 1/n. We used a step-size of  = 1/L and we used m = |Bs| which gave good performance across
methods and datasets. In our first experiment, we compared three variants of SVRG: the original strategy that uses all n examples to form s (Full), a growing batch strategy that sets |Bs| = 2s
(Grow), and the mixed SG/SVRG described by Algorithm 2 under this same choice (Mixed). While
a variety of practical batching methods have been proposed in the literature [13, 20, 21], we did not
find that any of these strategies consistently outperformed the doubling used by the simple Grow

strategy. Our second experiment focused on the 2-regularized HSVM on the same datasets, and we compared the original SVRG algorithm with variants that try to identify the support vectors (SV).
We plot the experimental results for one run of the algorithms on one dataset in Figure 1, while Appendix F reports results on the other 8 datasets over 10 different runs. In our results, the growing batch strategy (Grow) always had better test error performance than using the full batch, while for large datasets it also performed substantially better in terms of the training objective. In contrast, the Mixed strategy sometimes helped performance and sometimes hurt performance. Utilizing support vectors often improved the training objective, often by large margins, but its effect on the test objective was smaller.
10 Discussion
As SVRG is the only memory-free method among the new stochastic linearly-convergent methods, it represents the natural method to use for a huge variety of machine learning problems. In this work we show that the convergence rate of the SVRG algorithm can be preserved even under an inexact approximation to the full gradient. We also showed that using mini-batches to approximate s gives a natural way to do this, explored the use of support vectors to further reduce the number of gradient evaluations, gave an analysis of the regularized SVRG update, and considered several new mini-batch strategies. Our theoretical and experimental results indicate that many of these simple modifications should be considered in any practical implementation of SVRG.

Abstract

Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference.

Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calcula-

tions; this makes it difficult for non-experts to use. We propose an automatic varia-

tional inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference ( );

we implement it in Stan (code available), a probabilistic programming system. In

the user provides a Bayesian model and a dataset, nothing else. We make

no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm

automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the vari-

ational objective. We compare

to

sampling across hierarchical gen-

eralized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model.

We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With

we can use

variational inference on any model we write in Stan.

1 Introduction
Bayesian inference is a powerful framework for analyzing data. We design a model for data using latent variables; we then analyze data by calculating the posterior density of the latent variables. For machine learning models, calculating the posterior is often difficult; we resort to approximation.
Variational inference ( ) approximates the posterior with a simpler distribution [1, 2]. We search over a family of simple distributions and find the member closest to the posterior. This turns approximate inference into optimization. has had a tremendous impact on machine learning; it is typically faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo ( ) sampling (as we show here too) and has recently scaled up to massive data [3].
Unfortunately, algorithms are difficult to derive. We must first define the family of approximating distributions, and then calculate model-specific quantities relative to that family to solve the variational optimization problem. Both steps require expert knowledge. The resulting algorithm is tied to both the model and the chosen approximation.
In this paper we develop a method for automating variational inference, automatic differentiation variational inference ( ). Given any model from a wide class (specifically, probability models differentiable with respect to their latent variables), determines an appropriate variational family and an algorithm for optimizing the corresponding variational objective. We implement in Stan [4], a flexible probabilistic programming system. Stan describes a high-level language to define probabilistic models (e.g., Figure 2) as well as a model compiler, a library of transformations, and an efficient automatic differentiation toolbox. With we can now use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.1 (See Appendices F to J.)

models and hierarchical generalized linear models in Section 3.

machine learning. Here we use with stochastic variational inference [3], giving an approximate

techniques cannot complete the analysis.

automates variational inference within the Stan probabilistic programming

system [4]. This draws on two major themes.

The first is a body of work that aims to generalize . Kingma and Welling [6] and Rezende et al. [7] describe a reparameterization of the variational problem that simplifies optimization. Ranganath et al. [8] and Salimans and Knowles [9] propose a black-box technique, one that only requires the model and the gradient of the approximating family. Titsias and Lazaro-Gredilla [10] leverage the gradient of the joint density for a small class of models. Here we build on and extend these ideas to automate variational inference; we highlight technical connections as we develop the method.

The second theme is probabilistic programming. Wingate and Weber [11] study in general probabilistic programs, as supported by languages like Church [12], Venture [13], and Anglican [14]. Another probabilistic programming system is infer.NET, which implements variational message passing [15], an efficient algorithm for conditionally conjugate graphical models. Stan supports a more comprehensive class of nonconjugate models with differentiable latent variables; see Section 2.1.

2 Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference
Automatic differentiation variational inference ( ) follows a straightforward recipe. First we transform the support of the latent variables to the real coordinate space. For example, the logarithm transforms a positive variable, such as a standard deviation, to the real line. Then we posit a Gaussian variational distribution to approximate the posterior. This induces a non-Gaussian approximation in the original variable space. Last we combine automatic differentiation with stochastic optimization to maximize the variational objective. We begin by defining the class of models we support.
2.1 Differentiable Probability Models
Consider a dataset X D x1WN with N observations. Each xn is a discrete or continuous random vector. The likelihood p.X j A/ relates the observations to a set of latent random variables A. Bayesian

analysis posits a prior density p.A/ on the latent variables. Combining the likelihood with the prior gives the joint density p.X; A/ D p.X j A/ p.A/.
We focus on approximate inference for differentiable probability models. These models have continuous latent variables A. They also have a gradient of the log-joint with respect to the latent variables rA log p.X; A/. The gradient is valid within the support of the prior supp.p.A// D  A j A 2 RK and p.A/ > 0  A RK, where K is the dimension of the latent variable space. This support set is important: it determines the support of the posterior density and plays a key role later in the paper. We make no assumptions about conjugacy, either full or conditional.2
For example, consider a model that contains a Poisson likelihood with unknown rate, p.x j A /. The observed variable x is discrete; the latent rate A is continuous and positive. Place a Weibull prior on A, defined over the positive real numbers. The resulting joint density describes a nonconjugate differentiable probability model. (See Figure 2.) Its partial derivative @=@A p.x; A / is valid within the support of the Weibull distribution, supp.p.A // D RC R. Because this model is nonconjugate, the posterior is not a Weibull distribution. This presents a challenge for classical variational inference. In Section 2.3, we will see how handles this model.
Many machine learning models are differentiable. For example: linear and logistic regression, matrix factorization with continuous or discrete measurements, linear dynamical systems, and Gaussian processes. Mixture models, hidden Markov models, and topic models have discrete random variables. Marginalizing out these discrete variables renders these models differentiable. (We show an example in Section 3.3.) However, marginalization is not tractable for all models, such as the Ising model, sigmoid belief networks, and (untruncated) Bayesian nonparametric models.

2.2 Variational Inference

Bayesian inference requires the posterior density p.A j X/, which describes how the latent variables vary when conditioned on a set of observations X. Many posterior densities are intractable because
their normalization constants lack closed forms. Thus, we seek to approximate the posterior.

Consider an approximating density q.A I / parameterized by . We make no assumptions about its shape or support. We want to find the parameters of q.A I / to best match the posterior according to
some loss function. Variational inference ( ) minimizes the Kullback-Leibler ( ) divergence from
the approximation to the posterior [2],

D arg min KL.q.A I / k p.A j X//:

(1)

Typically the divergence also lacks a closed form. Instead we maximize the evidence lower bound ( ), a proxy to the divergence,
L. / D Eq.A/ log p.X; A/ Eq.A/ log q.A I / :

The first term is an expectation of the joint density under the approximation, and the second is the

entropy of the variational density. Maximizing the

minimizes the divergence [1, 16].

2The posterior of a fully conjugate model is in the same family as the prior; a conditionally conjugate model has this property within the complete conditionals of the model [3].

3

The minimization problem from Eq. (1) becomes D arg max L. / such that supp.q.A I // A supp.p.A j X//:

(2)

We explicitly specify the support-matching constraint implied in the divergence.3 We highlight
this constraint, as we do not specify the form of the variational approximation; thus we must ensure that q.A I / stays within the support of the posterior, which is defined by the support of the prior.

Why is difficult to automate? In classical variational inference, we typically design a conditionally conjugate model. Then the optimal approximating family matches the prior. This satisfies the support constraint by definition [16]. When we want to approximate models that are not conditionally conjugate, we carefully study the model and design custom approximations. These depend on the model and on the choice of the approximating density.

One way to automate is to use black-box variational inference [8, 9]. If we select a density whose

support matches the posterior, then we can directly maximize the

using Monte Carlo ( )

integration and stochastic optimization. Another strategy is to restrict the class of models and use a

fixed variational approximation [10]. For instance, we may use a Gaussian density for inference in unrestrained differentiable probability models, i.e. where supp.p.A// D RK.

We adopt a transformation-based approach. First we automatically transform the support of the latent variables in our model to the real coordinate space. Then we posit a Gaussian variational density. The transformation induces a non-Gaussian approximation in the original variable space and guarantees that it stays within the support of the posterior. Here is how it works.

2.3 Automatic Transformation of Constrained Variables

Begin by transforming the support of the latent variables A such that they live in the real coordinate space RK. Define a one-to-one differentiable function T W supp.p.A// ! RK and identify the transformed variables as D T .A/. The transformed joint density g.X; / is

g.X;

/ D p X; T

where p is the joint density in the original latent variable space, and JT 1 is the Jacobian of the inverse of T . Transformations of continuous probability densities require a Jacobian; it accounts for
how the transformation warps unit volumes [17]. (See Appendix D.)
Consider again our running example. The rate A lives in RC. The logarithm D T .A / D log.A / transforms RC to the real line R. Its Jacobian adjustment is the derivative of the inverse of the logarithm, j det JT 1. /j D exp. /. The transformed density is

g.x; / D Poisson.x j exp. // Weibull.exp. / I 1:5; 1/ exp. /:

Figures 3a and 3b depict this transformation.

As we describe in the introduction, we implement our algorithm in Stan to enable generic inference. Stan implements a model compiler that automatically handles transformations. It works by applying a library of transformations and their corresponding Jacobians to the joint model density.4 This transforms the joint density of any differentiable probability model to the real coordinate space. Now we can choose a variational distribution independent from the model.

2.4 Implicit Non-Gaussian Variational Approximation

The vector D . 1; ; K; 1; ; K/ contains the mean and standard deviation of each Gaussian factor. This defines our variational approximation in the real coordinate space. (Figure 3b.)
The transformation T maps the support of the latent variables to the real coordinate space; its inverse T 1 maps back to the support of the latent variables. This implicitly defines the variational approximation in the original latent variable space as q.T .A/ I / det JT .A/: The transformation ensures that the support of this approximation is always bounded by that of the true posterior in the original latent variable space (Figure 3a). Thus we can freely optimize the in the real coordinate space (Figure 3b) without worrying about the support matching constraint.

where we plug in the analytic form of the Gaussian entropy. (The derivation is in Appendix A.)

We choose a diagonal Gaussian for efficiency. This choice may call to mind the Laplace approximation technique, where a second-order Taylor expansion around the maximum-a-posteriori estimate gives a Gaussian approximation to the posterior. However, using a Gaussian variational approximation is not equivalent to the Laplace approximation [18]. The Laplace approximation relies on maximizing the probability density; it fails with densities that have discontinuities on its boundary. The Gaussian approximation considers probability mass; it does not suffer this degeneracy. Furthermore, our approach is distinct in another way: because of the transformation, the posterior approximation in the original latent variable space (Figure 3a) is non-Gaussian.

over, the standard deviations in must remain positive. Thus, we employ one final transformation: elliptical standardization5 [19], shown in Figures 3b and 3c.

3 Empirical Study

We now study across a variety of models. We compare its speed and accuracy to two Markov

chain Monte Carlo ( ) sampling algorithms: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ( ) [22] and the no-

U-turn sampler ( )6 [5]. We assess

convergence by tracking the . To place

and

on a common scale, we report predictive likelihood on held-out data as a function of time. We

approximate the posterior predictive likelihood using a estimate. For

, we plug in posterior

samples. For , we draw samples from the posterior approximation during the optimization. We

initialize with a draw from a standard Gaussian.

We explore two hierarchical regression models, two matrix factorization models, and a mixture
model. All of these models have nonconjugate prior structures. We conclude by analyzing a dataset of 250 000 images, where we report results across a range of minibatch sizes B.

3.1 A Comparison to Sampling: Hierarchical Regression Models

We begin with two nonconjugate regression models: linear regression with automatic relevance determination ( ) [16] and hierarchical logistic regression [23].

Linear Regression with . This is a sparse linear regression model with a hierarchical prior structure. (Details in Appendix F.) We simulate a dataset with 250 regressors such that half of the regressors have no predictive power. We use 10 000 training samples and hold out 1000 for testing.

Logistic Regression with Spatial Hierarchical Prior. This is a hierarchical logistic regression
model from political science. The prior captures dependencies, such as states and regions, in a
polling dataset from the United States 1988 presidential election [23]. (Details in Appendix G.) We train using 10 000 data points and withhold 1536 for evaluation. The regressors contain age, education, state, and region indicators. The dimension of the regression problem is 145.

Results. Figure 4 plots average log predictive accuracy as a function of time. For these simple

models, all methods reach the same predictive accuracy. We study

with two settings of M , the

number of samples used to estimate gradients. A single sample per iteration is sufficient; it is also the fastest. (We set M D 1 from here on.)

3.2 Exploring Nonconjugacy: Matrix Factorization Models
We continue by exploring two nonconjugate non-negative matrix factorization models: a constrained Gamma Poisson model [24] and a Dirichlet Exponential model. Here, we show how easy it is to explore new models using . In both models, we use the Frey Face dataset, which contains 1956 frames (28 20 pixels) of facial expressions extracted from a video sequence.
Constrained Gamma Poisson. This is a Gamma Poisson factorization model with an ordering constraint: each row of the Gamma matrix goes from small to large values. (Details in Appendix H.)

We conclude with the Gaussian mixture model ( ) example we highlighted earlier. This is a

nonconjugate

applied to color image histograms. We place a Dirichlet prior on the mixture

proportions, a Gaussian prior on the component means, and a lognormal prior on the standard deviations. (Details in Appendix J.) We explore the image dataset, which has 250 000 images [25]. We withhold 10 000 images for evaluation.

In Figure 1a we randomly select 1000 images and train a model with 10 mixture components. struggles to find an adequate solution and fails altogether. This is likely due to label switching, which can affect -based techniques in mixture models [4].

minibatch size of 500 or larger, reaches high predictive accuracy. Smaller minibatch sizes lead

to suboptimal solutions, an effect also observed in [3].

We develop automatic differentiation variational inference ( ) in Stan. leverages automatic transformations, an implicit non-Gaussian variational approximation, and automatic differentiation. This is a valuable tool. We can explore many models and analyze large datasets with ease. We emphasize that is currently available as part of Stan; it is ready for anyone to use.

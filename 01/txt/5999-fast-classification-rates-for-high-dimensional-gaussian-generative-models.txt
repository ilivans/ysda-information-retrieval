Abstract

We consider the problem of binary classification when the covariates conditioned

on the each of the response values follow multivariate Gaussian distributions. We

focus on the setting where the covariance matrices for the two conditional dis-

tributions are the same. The corresponding generative model classifier, derived

via the Bayes rule, also called Linear Discriminant Analysis, has been shown to

behave poorly in high-dimensional settings. We present a novel analysis of the

classification error of any linear discriminant approach given conditional Gaussian

models. This allows us to compare the generative model classifier, other recently

proposed discriminative approaches that directly learn the discriminant function,

and then finally logistic regression which is another classical discriminative model

classifier. As we show, under a natural sparsity assumption, and letting s denote

the sparsity of the Bayes classifier, p the number of covariates, and n the num-

ber of samples, the simple ( 1-regularized) logistic regression classifier achieves

the fast misclassification error rates of O

s log p n

, which is much better than the

other approaches, which are either inconsistent under high-dimensional settings,

or achieve a slower rate of O

s log p n

.

1 Introduction
We consider the problem of classification of a binary response given p covariates. A popular class of approaches are statistical decision-theoretic: given a classification evaluation metric, they then optimize a surrogate evaluation metric that is computationally tractable, and yet have strong guarantees on sample complexity, namely, number of observations required for some bound on the expected classification evaluation metric. These guarantees and methods have been developed largely for the zero-one evaluation metric, and extending these to general evaluation metrics is an area of active research. Another class of classification methods are relatively evaluation metric agnostic, which is an important desideratum in modern settings, where the evaluation metric for an application is typically less clear: these are based on learning statistical models over the response and covariates, and can be categorized into two classes. The first are so-called generative models, where we specify conditional distributions of the covariates conditioned on the response, and then use the Bayes rule to derive the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates. The second are the socalled discriminative models, where we directly specify the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates.
In the classical fixed p setting, we have now have a good understanding of the performance of the classification approaches above. For generative and discriminative modeling based approaches, consider the specific case of Naive Bayes generative models and logistic regression discriminative models (which form a so-called generative-discriminative pair1), Ng and Jordan [27] provided qual-

itative consistency analyses, and showed that under small sample settings, the generative model classifiers converge at a faster rate to their population error rate compared to the discriminative model classifiers, though the population error rate of the discriminative model classifiers could be potentially lower than that of the generative model classifiers due to weaker model assumptions. But if the generative model assumption holds, then generative model classifiers seem preferable to discriminative model classifiers.

In this paper, we investigate whether this conventional wisdom holds even under high-dimensional settings. We focus on the simple generative model where the response is binary, and the covariates conditioned on each of the response values, follows a conditional multivariate Gaussian distribution. We also assume that the two covariance matrices of the two conditional Gaussian distributions are the same. The corresponding generative model classifier, derived via the Bayes rule, is known in the statistics literature as the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier [21]. Under classical settings where p n, the misclassification error rate of this classifier has been shown to converge to that of the Bayes classifier. However, in a high-dimensional setting, where the number of covariates p could scale with the number of samples n, this performance of the LDA classifier breaks down. In particular, Bickel and Levina [3] show that when p/n  , then the LDA classifier could converge to an error rate of 0.5, that of random chance. What should one then do, when we are even allowed this generative model assumption, and when p > n?

Bickel and Levina [3] suggest the use of a Naive Bayes or conditional independence assumption, which in the conditional Gaussian context, assumes the covariance matrices to be diagonal. As they showed, the corresponding Naive Bayes LDA classifier does have misclassification error rate that is better than chance, but it is asymptotically biased: it converges to an error rate that is strictly larger than that of the Bayes classifier when the Naive Bayes conditional independence assumption does not hold. Bickel and Levina [3] also considered a weakening of the Naive Bayes rule, by assuming that the covariance matrix is weakly sparse, and an ellipsoidal constraint on the means, showed that an estimator that leverages these structural constraints converges to the Bayes risk at a rate of O(log(n)/n), where 0 <  < 1 depends on the mean and covariance structural assumptions. A caveat is that these covariance sparsity assumptions might not hold in practice. Similar caveats apply to the related works on feature annealed independence rules [14], nearest shrunken centroids [29, 30], as well as those . Moreover, even when the assumptions hold, they do not yield the "fast" rates of O(1/n).

An alternative approach is to directly impose sparsity on the linear discriminant [28, 7], which is weaker than the covariance sparsity assumptions (though [28] impose these in addition). [28, 7] then proposed new estimators that leveraged these assumptions, but while they were able to show

convergence to the Bayes risk, they were only able to show a slower rate of O

s log p n

.

It is instructive at this juncture to look at recent results on classification error rates from the machine learning community. A key notion of importance here is whether the two classes are separable: which can be understood as requiring that the classification error of the Bayes classifier is 0. Classical learning theory gives a rate of O(1/ n) for any classifier when two classes are non-separable, and it shown that this is also minimax [12], with the note that this is relatively distribution agnostic, since it assumes very little on the underlying distributions. When the two classes are non-separable, only rates slower than (1/n) are known. Another key notion is a "low-noise condition" [25], under which certain classifiers can be shown to attain a rate faster than o(1/ n), albeit not at the O(1/n) rate unless the two classes are separable. Specifically, let  denote a constant such that

P (|P(Y = 1|X) - 1/2|  t)  O (t) ,

(1)

holds when t  0. This is said to be a low-noise assumption, since as   +, the two classes

start becoming separable, that is, the Bayes risk approaches zero. Under this low-noise assumption,

known rates for excess 0-1 risk is O

[23].

Note

that

this

is

always

slower

than

O(

)

when  < +.

There has been a surge of recent results on high-dimensional statistical statistical analyses of M estimators [26, 9, 1]. These however are largely focused on parameter error bounds, empirical and population log-likelihood, and sparsistency. In this paper however, we are interested in analyzing the zero-one classification error under high-dimensional sampling regimes. One could stitch these recent results to obtain some error bounds: use bounds on the excess log-likelihood, and use trans-

2

forms from [2], to convert excess log-likelihood bounds to get bounds on 0-1 classification error, however, the resulting bounds are very loose, and in particular, do not yield the fast rates that we seek.

In this paper, we leverage the closed form expression for the zero-one classification error for our

generative model, and directly analyse it to give faster rates for any linear discriminant method.

Our analyses show that, assuming a sparse linear discriminant in addition, the simple 1-regularized

logistic regression classifier achieves near optimal fast rates of O

s log p n

, even without requiring

that the two classes be separable.

2 Problem Setup

We consider the problem of high dimensional binary classification under the following generative

model. Let Y  {0, 1} denote a binary response variable, and let X = (X1, . . . , Xp)  Rp denote

a set of p covariates.

For technical simplicity, we assume Pr[Y

= 1] = Pr[Y

= 0] =

1 2

,

however

our analysis easily extends to the more general case when Pr[Y = 1], Pr[Y = 0]  [0, 1 - 0], for

some constant 0 < 0

<

1 2

.

We assume that X|Y

 N (Y , Y ), i.e. conditioned on a response, the

covariate follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We assume we are given n training samples

{(X(1), Y (1)), (X(2), Y (2)), . . . , (X(n), Y (n))} drawn i.i.d. from the conditional Gaussian model

above.

For any classifier, C : Rp  {1, 0}, the 0-1 risk or simply the classification error is given by

R0-1(C) = EX,Y [ 0-1(C(X), Y )], where 0-1(C(x), y) = 1(C(x) = y) is the 0-1 loss. It can

also be simply written as R(C) = Pr[C(X) = Y ]. The classifier attaining the lowest classification

error is known as the Bayes classifier, which we will denote by C. Under the generative model

assumption

above,

the

Bayes

classifier

can

be

derived

simply

as

C  (X )

=

1(log

Pr[Y =1|X] Pr[Y =0|X]

>

0),

so

that

given

sample

X,

it

would

be

classified

as

1

if

Pr[Y =1|X] Pr[Y =0|X]

>

1,

and

as

0

otherwise.

We

denote

the error of the Bayes classifier R = R(C).

When 1 = 0 = ,

log

Pr[Y Pr[Y

= 1|X] = 0|X]

= (1 - 0)T -1X

(-T1

(2)

and we denote this quantity as wT X + b where

w

=

-1(1

- 0),

b

=

-T1 -11 + T0 -10 , 2

so that the Bayes classifier can be written as: C(x) = 1(wT x + b > 0).

For any trained classifier C we are interested in bounding the excess risk defined as R(C) - R. The generative approach to training a classifier is to estimate estimate -1and  from data, and

then plug the estimates into Equation 2 to construct the classifier. This classifier is known as the

linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, whose theoretical properties have been well-studied

in

classical

fixed

p

setting.

The

discriminative

approach

to

training

is

to

estimate

Pr[Y =1|X] Pr[Y =0|X]

directly

from samples.

2.1 Assumptions.

We assume that mean is bounded i.e. 1, 0  {  Rp :  2  B}, where B is a constant

which doesn't scale with p. We assume that the covariance matrix  is non-degenerate i.e. all

eigenvalues which gives

of a

 are lower

in [Bmin , bound on

Bmax ]. Additionally the Bayes classifier's

we assume (1 - 0)T classification error R

-1(1 - 0)  Bs,

-

(

1 2

Bs

)

>

0.

Note that this assumption is different from the definition of separable classes in [11] and the low

noise condition in [25], and the two classes are still not separable because R > 0.

2.1.1 Sparsity Assumption.
Motivated by [7], we assume that -1(1 - 0) is sparse, and there at most s non-zero entries. Cai and Liu [7] extensively discuss and show that such a sparsity assumption, is much weaker than assuming either -1 and (1 - 0) to be individually sparse. We refer the reader to [7] for an elaborate discussion.

2.2 Generative Classifiers
Generative techniques work by estimating -1 and (1 - 0) from data and plugging them into Equation 2. In high-dimensions, simple estimation techniques do not perform well when p n, the sample estimate for the covariance matrix  is singular; using the generalized inverse of the sample covariance matrix makes the estimator highly biased and unstable. Numerous alternative approaches have been proposed by imposing structural conditions on  or -1 and  to ensure that they can be estimated consistently. Some early work based on nearest shrunken centroids [29, 30], feature annealed independence rules [14], and Naive Bayes [4] imposed independence assumptions on , which are often violated in real-world applications. [4, 13] impose more complex structural assumptions on the covariance matrix and suggest more complicated thresholding techniques. Most commonly, -1 and  are assumed to be sparse and then some thresholding techniques are used to estimate them consistently [17, 28].

2.3 Discriminative Classifiers.

Recently, more direct techniques have been proposed to solve the sparse LDA problem. Let 

and d be consistent estimators of  and 

=

1

+0 2

.

Fan et al. [15] proposed the Regularized

Optimal Affine Discriminant (ROAD) approach which minimizes wT w with wT  restricted to be

a constant value and an 1-penalty of w.

wROAD = argmin wT w
wT =1 ||w||1 c

(3)

Kolar and Liu [22] provided theoretical insights into the ROAD estimator by analysing its consis-

tency for variable selection. Cai and Liu [7] proposed another variant called linear programming discriminant (LPD) which tries to make w close to the Bayes rules linear term -1(1 - 0) in the  norm. This can be cast as a linear programming problem related to the Dantzig selector.[8].

wLPD = argmin ||w||1
w

(4)

s.t.||w - ||  n

Mai et al. [24]proposed another version of the sparse linear discriminant analysis based on an equiv-
alent least square formulation of the LDA, where they solve an 1-regularized least squares problem to produce a consistent classifier.

All the techniques above either do not have finite sample convergence rates, or the 0-1 risk converged

at a slow rate of O

s log p n

.

In this paper, we first provide an analysis of classification error rates for any classifier with a linear discriminant function, and then follow this analysis by investigating the performance of generative and discriminative classifiers for conditional Gaussian model.

3 Classifiers with Sparse Linear Discriminants

We first analyze any classifier with a linear discriminant function, of the form: C(x) = 1(wT x+b > 0). We first note that the 0-1 classification error of any such classifier is available in closed-form as

R(w,

b)

=

1

-

1 

wT 1 + b

- 1

- wT 0 + b

,

2

wT w

2

wT w

(5)

which can be shown by noting that wT X + b is a univariate normal random variable when conditioned on the label Y .

Next, we relate the 0-1 classifiction error above to that of the Bayes classifier. Recall the earlier notation of the Bayes classifier as C(x) = 1(xT w + b > 0). The following theorem is a key

result of the paper that shows that for any linear discriminant classifier whose linear discriminant

parameters are close to that of the Bayes classifier, the excess 0-1 risk is bounded only by second

order terms of the difference. Note that this theorem will enable fast classification rates if we obtain

fast rates for the parameter error.

Theorem 1. Let w = w + , b = b + , and   0,   0, then we have

R(w

= w + , b = b + ) - R(w, b) = O(

Proof. Denote the quantity S =

(1 - 0)T -1(1 - 0),

then

we

have

T1 w+b wT w

.

Using (5) and the Taylor series expansion of (*) around

we

Combing the above bounds we get the desired result.

4 Logistic Regression Classifier

In this section, we show that the simple 1 regularized logistic regression classifier attains fast classification error rates.

Specifically, we are interested in the M -estimator [21] below:

(w, b) = arg min 1 w,b n

(Y (i)(wT X(i) + b) + log(1 + exp(wT X(i) + b))) + ( w 1 + |b|) , (10)

which maximizes the penalized log-likelihood of the logistic regression model, which also corresponds to the conditional probability of the response given the covariates P(Y |X) for the conditional Gaussian model.

Note that here we penalize the intercept term b as well. Although the intercept term usually is not penalized (e.g. [19]), some packages (e.g. [16]) penalize the intercept term. Our analysis show that penalizing the intercept term does not degrade the performance of the classifier.

In [2, 31] it is shown that minimizing the expected risk of the logistic loss also minimizes the
classification error for the corresponding linear classifier. 1 regularized logistic regression is a popular classification method in many settings [18, 5]. Several commonly used packages ([19, 16])
have been developed for 1 regularized logistic regression. And recent works ([20, 10]) have been on scaling regularized logistic regression to ultra-high dimensions and large number of samples.

4.1 Analysis

We first show that 1 regularized logistic regression estimator above converges to the Bayes classifier parameters using techniques. Next we use the theorem from the previous section to argue that since estimated parameter w, b is close to the Bayes classifier's parameter w, b, the excess risk of the
classifier using estimated parameter is tightly bounded as well.

For the first step, we first show a restricted eigenvalue condition for X = (X, 1) where X are our

covariates,

that

comes

from

a

mixture

of

Gaussian

distributions

(0,

).

Note

that X is not zero centered, which is different from existing scenarios ([26], [6], etc.) that assume

covariates are zero centered. And we denote w

= (w, b), S

=

{i

:

w

 i

=

0},

and

s

= |S |  s+1.

(11)

where w(A ) = Eg N (0,Ip+1)[supa A g T a ] is the Gaussian width of A . 
In the special case when A = {v : vS 1  3 vS 1, v 2 = 1}, we have w(A ) = O( s log p).

Proof. First note that X is sub-Gaussian with bounded parameter and

values of A and A-1 are lower bounded by  1 and upper bounded by

2 + B2. Let 1

be the minimum eigenvalue of  , and u1 ( u1 2 = 1) the corresponding eigenvector. From the expression AAT A-T u1 = 1Au1, so we know that the minimum eigenvalue of  is lower bounded. Similarly the largest eigenvalue of  is upper bounded. Then the desired result follows

the proof of Theorem 10 in [1]. Although the proof of Theorem 10 in [1] is for zero-centered random

variables, the proof remains valid for non zero-centered random variables. 
When A = {v : vS 1  3 vS 1, v 2 = 1}, [9] gives w(A ) = O( s log p).

Having established a restricted eigenvalue result in Lemma 1, next we use the result in [26] for pa-
rameter recovery in generalized linear models (GLMs) to show that 1 regularized logistic regression can recover the Bayes classifier parameters.

Proof. Following the proof of Lemma 1, we see that the conditions (GLM1) and (GLM2) in [26] are satisfied. Following the proof of Proposition 2 and Corollary 5 in [26], we have the desired result. Although the proof of Proposition 2 and Corollary 5 in [26] is for zero-centered random variables, the proof remains valid for non zero-centered random variables.

Combining Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 we have the following theorem which gives a fast rate for the excess 0-1 risk of a classifier trained using 1 regularized logistic regression.

5 Other Linear Discriminant Classifiers

In this section, we provide convergence results for the 0-1 risk for other linear discriminant classifiers discussed in Section 2.3.

Naive Bayes We compare the discriminative approach using 1 logistic regression to the generative approach using naive Bayes. For illustration purposes we conside the case where  = Ip, 1 =

M 1 s

1s 0p-s

and

0

=

-

M 0 s

1s 0p-s

.

where 0

M1, M0

constants.

In

this

case

w

=

M1+M0 s

1s 0p-s

and

b

(-M12

+ M02).

Using

naive

Bayes

we

es-

timate w = 1 - 0, where 1 =

1 1(Y

(i)

=1

)

Y (i)=1 X(i) and 0 =

1 1(Y

(i)

=0

)

Y (i)=0 X (i).

Thus with high probability, we have

w - w

2 2

=

O(

p n

),

using

Theorem

1

we

get

a

slower

rate

than the bound given in Theorem 2 for discriminative classification using 1 regularized logistic

regression.

LPD [7] LPD uses a linear programming similar to the Dantzig selector.

Lemma 3 (Cai and Liu [7], Theorem 4). Let n = C

s log p n

with

C

being

a

sufficiently

large

constant. Let n > log p, let  = (1 - 0)T -1(1 - 0) > c1 for some constant c1 > 0, and let wLPD be obtained as in Equation 4, then with probability greater than 1 - O(p-1), we have

R(wLPD) R

-1

=

O(

s

log n

p

).

SLDA [28] SLDA uses thresholded estimate for  and 1 - 0. We state a simpler version.

Lemma 4 ([28], Theorem 3).

Assume that  and 1 - 0 are sparse, then we have

R(wSLDA) R

-1 =

O(max((

and

)

are

constants.

ROAD [15] ROAD minimizes wT w with wT  restricted to be a constant value and an 1-penalty of w.

Lemma 5 (Fan et al. [15], Theorem 1). Assume that with high probability, || -|| = O(

log n

p

)

and ||-|| = O(

log n

p

),

and

let

wROAD

be

obtained

as

in

Equation

then

with

high

probability,

we have R(wROAD) - R = O(

p

).

6 Experiments

In this section we describe experiments which illustrate the rates for excess 0-1 risk given in Theorem 2. In our experiments we use Glmnet [19] where we set the option to penalize the intercept term along with all other parameters. Glmnet is popular package for 1 regularized logistic regression using coordinate descent methods.

(c) Dependence of excess 0-1 risk on n.

Figure 1: Simulations for different Gaussian classification problems showing the dependence of classification error on different quantities. All experiments plotted the average of 20 trials. In all

experiments we set the regularization parameter  =

log n

p

.

we vary p while keeping s, (1 - 0)T -1(1 - 0) constant. Figure 1a shows for different p how

the classification error changes with increasing n. In Figure 1a we show the relationship between

the

classification

error

and

the

quantity

n log

p

.

This

figure

agrees

with

our

result

on

excess

0-1

risk's

dependence on p. In Figure 1b we vary s while keeping p, (1 - 0)T -1(1 - 0) constant.

Figure 1b shows for different s how the classification error changes with increasing n. In Figure 1a

we

show

the

relationship

between

the

classification

error

and

the

quantity

n s

.

This

figure

agrees

with

our result on excess 0-1 risk's dependence on s. In Figure 1c we show how R(w, b) - R(w, b)

changes

with

respect

to

1 n

in

one

instance

Gaussian

classification.

We can

see

that

the

excess

0-1

risk achieves the fast rate and agrees with our bound.
